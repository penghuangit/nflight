<h1>Status of an Async Request</h1>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This frame class displays the status of an Asynchronous Request.&nbsp; See also the <u>Stalled</u>
    display for ways to deal with those requests that are stalled.</p>
    <p>The non-frame version of this class is <u>TyUserStatus</u>, below.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3><strong>Elements</strong></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tymeac MilliTime</strong> -- MilliTime is the time in milliseconds since 1970
  when the Tymeac Server started.&nbsp; This value is printed/logged at Tymeac start up and
  shut down.&nbsp; This value is returned to the requestor of an Asynchronous Request along
  with the request id, below.&nbsp; This element is necessary to insure that the Tymeac
  Client and&nbsp;Server are coordinated.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Request Id</strong> --&nbsp; This value is returned to the requestor of an
  Asynchronous Request along with the MilliTime, above.&nbsp; This is a sequential number,
  from 1, incremented for each request since Tymeac start up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><strong>Buttons</strong></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>GET</strong> -- Passes the request to the Tymeac Server and displays the Msg,
  below.</p>
  <p><strong>CANCEL</strong> -- Passes the request to the Tymeac Server and displays the
  Msg, below.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A cancel request may only succeed when either no Queue Threads have started to process
    the Function or the Function is in-progress. There is no way to interrupt the Output Agent
    processing.</p>
  </blockquote>

<hr>

<p><strong>Message Block at bottom :</strong> -- This is an information message.&nbsp; The
Bold number in parenthesis does not appear in the message.&nbsp; It is the return integer
from the Class, TyUserStatus, below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><u>Connection failure</u> -- <strong>(-1) </strong>The RMI connection failed or the
  Tymeac Server returned an invalid message.</p>
  <p><u>Tymeac shutting down</u> -- <strong>(4) </strong>Tymeac Server is in shut down mode.</p>
  <p><u>Tymeac MilliTime is not a valid number</u> -- Not a number.</p>
  <p><u>Request Id is not a valid number</u> -- Not a number.</p>
  <p><u>Request Id is invalid this session</u> -- <strong>(3) </strong>The request is
  greater than the highest used number so far.</p>
  <p><u>Tymeac MilliTime mismatch with current session</u> -- <strong>(5) </strong>The
  MilliTime does not match the current Tymeac start up time.</p>
  <p><u>Request is stalled</u> -- <strong>(6) </strong>As indicated.&nbsp; Use the <u>Stalled</u>
  display for more information and ways to deal with this request..</p>
  <p><u>Request is not in the system</u> -- <strong>(7)</strong>&nbsp; The request finished.
  &nbsp; This does not imply success or otherwise.</p>
  <p><u>Request is awaiting execu</u>tion -- <strong>(8)</strong> The request was found in a
  Wait List with no Queue's finished processing.</p>
  <p><u>Request is executing at OA stage</u> -- <strong>(9)</strong>&nbsp;The request
  finished processing in all the Queues for the Function.&nbsp; The last Tymeac Queue Thread
  to finish schedules the Output Agent Queue.&nbsp; It is at this stage: scheduling or
  executing.</p>
  <p><u>Request is executing</u> -- <strong>(10)</strong> The request is executing in at
  least one of the Queues for the Function.</p>
  <p><u>Request cancelled. No processing took place.</u> -- <strong>(11)</strong> The cancel
  request was successful. All the pending requests were removed from the waitlists before
  any Queue Thread could process them.</p>
  <p><u>Request cancelled. Was in progress</u>.&quot; -- <strong>(12)</strong> The cancel
  request was successful. At least one Queue Thread picked up the request before it could be
  flushed. This request may show up in the Stalled Array List since the resources could not
  be freed.</p>
