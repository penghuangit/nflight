<p><strong>Message Block at bottom :</strong> -- This is an information message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><u>Tymeac SD(0000)</u> -- The request completed successfully.&nbsp;The remainder of the
  message is release dependent but always contains the Tymeac Server MilliTime (start up
  time in milliseconds.)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><u>Tymeac SD(2010)</u> -- &quot;Shutdown forced past active threads, awaiting
  termination.&quot; This is the same as return code 0000 except there were active threads
  and a force shutdown was requested.</p>
  <p><u>Tymeac SD(2020)</u> -- The request did not complete successfully.&nbsp;Some Threads
  are still active.&nbsp;The remainder of the message is release dependent but always
  includes the number of Threads remaining.</p>
  <p><u>Tymeac SD(2030)</u> -- &quot;Prior shutdown completed normal, awaiting
  termination&quot;. The server request processing function terminated. A subsequent request
  was made for shutdown. The request was ignored. If the shut down thread was not part of
  the Server then the Server only ends when the main JVM ends.</p>
