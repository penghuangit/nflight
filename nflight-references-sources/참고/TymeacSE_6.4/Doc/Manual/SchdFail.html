<h1>Tymeac Scheduling Failures</h1>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This section discusses the common reasons why Tymeac Queues fail to schedule.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Scheduling failures (<a href="Usage.html#rc">return code</a> greater than zero) come
    under these categories: </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Shut Down,</li>
      <li>Time-out,</li>
      <li>No available Wait List, and&nbsp; </li>
      <li>No available thread.</li>
    </ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Shut down</b><br>
  Tymeac is shutting down.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>If shut down comes in the middle of scheduling queues for a request, then 
  the queue that failed scheduling is identified on the return code. Tymeac 
  attempts to back out the queues that scheduled normally, but there are no 
  guarantees.</p>
  <p>If shut down comes during a recursive call, then Tymeac does the same as 
  above. However, this may have a seriously negative affect on your logic.</p>
  <p>If shut down comes during scheduling of an Output Agent Queue, the only 
  time this fails is when the shut down is by force. The Queue in failure stalls 
  the request. There is no recovery for this situation since no new threads may 
  be created during forced shut down. You may use the <a href="TyStalled.html">
  Stalled request </a>display to purge the request or use the
  <a href="Shutdown.html#kill">shut-kill request</a> to terminate the Server.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><a name="timeout"></a><strong>Time-out</strong>, <br>
  for <a href="Definitions.html#sync">Synchronous Requests</a>, means that all components
  (Queues) of the request did not finish within the interval requested. Tymeac starts timing
  the request <u>after scheduling all Queues</u>.&nbsp;If, at the moment of expired time,
  the last Queue finishes, then there is no time-out. (See the
  <a href="Usage.html#timeout">return code</a> to your application for an 
  important message about the return objects.) The time-out interval is unique for
  each request and is the user's responsibility to adjust.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>For peak processing periods, an
    increase in the wait time may be sufficient.&nbsp;However, the time-out may be due to
    problems relating to excessive time in application classes (i.e., waiting for
    strings/threads, locks, or other resources.) The On Request Statistics Class (<a href="TyStats.html">TyStats</a>) writes the entire Tymeac system picture to a DBMS Table
    or local file for review off-line.</p>

  <p><a name="wait"></a><strong>No Available Wait List</strong><br>
  may occur for several reasons.&nbsp;The section, <a href="Tuning.html">Tuning</a>, details
  Tymeac's Wait List processing.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The number of entries in Wait Lists may be inadequate for which the solution is to
    increase the number of entries.</p>
    <p>The number of Wait Lists, when used as an overflow mechanism, may be inadequate during
    peak requirements, for which the solution is to increase the number of Wait Lists.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The overflow mechanism also is true for prioritized Wait Lists. For priority 3, the
      request goes into Wait List 3. If Wait List 3 is full and there is no Wait List 4, the
      Scheduler rejects the request regardless of the status of Wait Lists 1 and 2.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>An analysis of priority as well as number of Wait Lists, and number in a Wait List is
    necessary.&nbsp;Class, <a href="TyQueMaint.html">TyQueMaint</a>, makes the DBMS changes to
    the Wait Lists.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In addition to the On Request Statistics mentioned above, several Classes are available
    for Wait Lists during execution.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Wait List Display Class (<a href="TyWlData.html">TyWlData</a>) is available for
    real time picture of the status of Wait Lists.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Queue Elements Display/Alter Class (<a href="TyQueData.html">TyQueData</a>) is
    available to alter the number of entries in a Queue's Wait Lists.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="center"><img src="Images/divider.gif" alt="divider.gif (931 bytes)" width="100" height="5"></p>
  <p><a name="thread"></a><strong>No Available thread</strong><br>
  is the condition when <strong>NO</strong> <a href="Definitions.html#quethread">Queue
  Thread </a>is available for </p>
  <ul>
    <li>notifying (waiting for work) or is </li>
    <li>actively processing a request (busy) or is </li>
    <li>about to process a request (activated or notified) or </li>
    <li>no thread is available to reactivate (available).</li>
    <li>The status of all threads is 'cancelled' or 'disabled'.</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The section &quot;<a href="Disabled.html">How Threads Become Disabled</a>&quot;
    describes how threads become 'disabled'.&nbsp;The Queue Thread Class (<a href="TyQueThd.html">TyQueThd</a>) is available to display/alter the status of Queue
    threads.</p>
