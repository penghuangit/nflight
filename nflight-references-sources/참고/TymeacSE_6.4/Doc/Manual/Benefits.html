<h2 style="text-align: justify"><a name="control"></a>Control for Asynchronous Threads</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>See Product description, <a href="../Brochure/Bennies.html#threads">Control for
  Asynchronous Threads</a>.</p>
  <p>Multi-threading goes back to the 1950's.&nbsp;Even languages like FORTRAN support
  multi-threading.</p>
  <p>What they do not support is a way to manage the threads, see <a href="../Brochure/BExPur.html#manage">problems</a>.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>An example of unmanaged threads is the Demonstration System multiple event Class.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="text-align: justify"><a href="TyDemoT3.html">TyDemoT3</a> is the Demonstration
    Class that can put a load on your system.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>TyDemoT3Bean, TyDemoT3Base, TyDemoT3Instant and TyDemoT3Thread are Classes in support
      thereof.&nbsp; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>TyDemoT3 does not manage the synchronous threads (TyDemoT3Thread).&nbsp;If something
    goes wrong, so what. Just kill the process and start over. This is simply a demonstration.
    We provide the source code.&nbsp;You can add/alter that which you like. Make the base
    array volatile.&nbsp;Add synchronized methods. This is not mission critical.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Tymeac can handle your mission critical applications.</p>
  <p>When applications run on servers in remote locations there is no easy way to kill the
  process and start over.&nbsp; When applications need multi phase commits across the
  network or handle money, they must be secure, reliable, manageable and fault tolerant.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Tymeac is secure.</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Tymeac runs on each server without direct connections to any other server [single
    affinity].</p>
    <p>Tymeac has no communication facilities.&nbsp;All RMI and ClassLoader
    processing within Tymeac is for local resources, only (<a href="TyVariables.html">TyVariables</a>,
    url_name).&nbsp; <a href="Develop.html#pap">Processing Application Classes</a> load with a
    custom loader for the local system only (findSystemClass()). Even <a href="TyNewCopy.html">new versions</a> of Processing Application Classes use a custom
    loader for the local system only (and a new Name Space).</p>
    <p>This ensures that no unauthorized modules enter the system.</p>
    <p>While it is true that your Processing Application Classes may violate encapsulation,
    Tymeac itself is secure.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Tymeac is reliable.</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Tymeac<sup><small>&#153;</small></sup> was originally designed to manage asynchronous
    tasks in the transaction processing environment.</p>
    <p>This is the 24/7 arena of international credit authorization, money transfers and all
    mission-critical applications.</p>
    <p>Tymeac<sup><small>&#153;</small></sup> grew up with the principal of &quot;no
    excuses&quot;.&nbsp;Today, all the features that make Tymeac<sup><small>&#153;</small></sup>
    a highly reliable, fully mission-critical software product are available for the Java<sup><small>&#153;</small></sup>
    Virtual Machine.<ul>
      <li>total number of 'threads per Queue' limits to prevent thread overload,</li>
      <li>thread creation / destruction as necessary,</li>
      <li>thread activation according to thresholds, not chance,</li>
      <li>prioritized Queues for requests,</li>
      <li>extensive monitoring of the thread environment to pinpoint stalls,</li>
      <li>integrated re-scheduling for stalled requests,</li>
      <li>interfacing with user-controlled notification systems when problems arise,</li>
      <li>support for synchronous (timed) requests as well as asynchronous (background) requests,</li>
      <li>GUI support to monitor and alter the environment for system personnel,</li>
      <li>logging of statistics at shutdown and on request,</li>
      <li>support for any DBMS through JDBC, to optionally store parameters and logs,</li>
      <li>support for any embedded DBMS,</li>
      <li>support for non-DBMS parameters for a minimal footprint.</li>
    </ul>

  <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Tymeac is manageable.</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Tymeac's <a href="TyFuncMaint.html">Functions</a> and <a href="TyQueMaint.html">Queues</a>
    were designed for manageability. </p>
    <p>Adding or removing a Queue (Normal or Output Agent) from a Function is only a matter of
    a table change.</p>
    <p>Changing the Processing Application Class that executes within a thread is only a
    matter of a table change.</p>
    <p>Adding or removing threads from a Queue is only a matter of a table change.</p>
    <p>Tymeac provides almost unlimited control for managing the <a href="TyQueMaint.html#threshold">new thread algorithm</a>.&nbsp;This assures that only
    those threads that are immediately necessary to process requests are active, saving <a href="Tuning.html#threads">valuable processor resources</a>.&nbsp; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><a href="Tuning.html#waitlists">Prioritized Wait Lists</a> provide the means to
    properly schedule requests and to assure users that the hot request gets immediate
    attention.</p>
    <p>The entire execution environment is viewable (<a href="TyQueThd.html">Threads</a>, <a href="TyWlData.html">Wait Lists</a>). <a href="TyQueThd.html">Thread status</a> is

  <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Tymeac is <a href="Benefits.html#failure">fault
  tolerant</a>.</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Optional <a href="TymeacParm.html">timing</a> of user requests provides 
    immediate notification of an abnormal event.</p>
    <p>Automatic <a href="SchdFail.html">back out</a> provides for intermediate component
    failure.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A Monitor thread thoroughly examines the system at set intervals reallocating and
    freeing resources, and, notifying the user&#146;s <a href="TyNotify.html">early warning
    system </a>of potential problems.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Tymeac is the easiest way to run a background process.&nbsp;The background process, or,
  back end -- back room, is common in the Enterprise. The Tymeac <a href="TySvrComm.html">Asynchronous
  Request</a> method is the means to feed the background task. The <a href="Definitions.html#client">Tymeac Client</a> accepts data and <a href="TymeacParm.html">passes</a> the Object to the Tymeac Server.&nbsp;The background
  process executes without any intervention from the requesting Tymeac Client.&nbsp;The <a href="ex1.html">examples</a>, revalue portfolio, is also an example of background
  processing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 style="text-align: justify">Reduced Processor Overhead</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>See Product description, <a href="../Brochure/Bennies.html#overhead">Reduced Processor
  Overhead</a>.</p>
  <p>The Messaging API and the DataBase API (JDBC) provide two prime examples of how Tymeac
  can cut overhead in your processing environment.</p>
  <p>Set up a Center (Messaging, DataBase, etc).&nbsp;Access to the Center is through a
  transport mechanism (RMI and CORBA are two such transports).&nbsp;When the first request
  arrives for a particular service, open the service and place the request therein.&nbsp; As
  each new request arrives, place the request therein. When at a threshold (either request
  limit or time-out) close the service.</p>
  <p>In this way, multiple requests can process between the open and the close.</p>
  <p>See the <a href="Demo.html">Demonstration System</a>.&nbsp;The Tymeac Functions for
  asynchronous processing with an Output Agent Queue are Functions 5, 6, and 7. The Output
  Agent Processing Application Class for these Tymeac Functions is DemoAgent1. Alter this
  Class to send the results of local processing to your Center.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 style="text-align: justify">Scalability</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p style="text-align: justify">See Product description, <a href="../Brochure/Bennies.html#scale">Scalability</a></p>
  <p>How many threads does a logical process need?&nbsp;The answer depends on the number of
  outstanding requests (load). The higher the load, the more threads may be needed to
  process requests.</p>
  <p>Tymeac<sup><small>&#153;</small></sup> provides four <a href="TyQueMaint.html#threshold">thresholds</a> to give designers control over this
  parameter. Tymeac<sup><small>&#153;</small></sup> <a href="TyQueMaint.html#start">creates
  a new thread</a> either at start up or when first needed (threshold processing) and <a href="TyQueMaint.html#kill">destroys the thread</a> either after an idle period or never.
  This is a dynamic response to an ever changing environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 style="text-align: justify">Facilitated Recursion Processing</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>See Product description, <a href="../Brochure/Bennies.html#recursion">Nested Processing</a></p>
  <p>See pattern, <a href="Patterns.html#recursion">Recursion</a>.</p>
  <p>Recursion is taught in compiler theory courses.&nbsp;The standard example is the
  parenthesis processor.&nbsp;Most languages support recursion, even going back as far as
  PL/1.</p>
  <p>What is not standard is how a separate, executing &quot;process&quot;, can call itself
  or another as a new thread. Just keeping track of the levels is exhausting. Add in
  component failures and stalls, and you need Tymeac.</p>
  <p>The <a href="Demo.html">Demonstration System</a> contains an example of recursion.
  Function_8 is the recursive processing <a href="Develop.html#function">Function</a>.
  The <a href="ex1.html">examples</a>, revalue portfolio, is also an example of how
  to use Tymeac recursion.</p>
  <p>The <a href="TyNotify.html">Notification System </a>is a recursive example. The <a href="Monitor.html">Tymeac Monitor</a>, when it finds a problem, calls itself, the Tymeac <a href="Definitions.html#broker">Server</a>, as a Tymeac <a href="Definitions.html#client">Client</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 style="text-align: justify">Simplified Application Development</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>See Product description, <a href="../Brochure/Bennies.html#repository">Concurrent
  Development</a>.</p>
  <p>Tymeac supports the construction of simple, single process objects. These <a href="Develop.html#pap">Processing Application Classes</a> run under Tymeac Threads.
  The object gets the input message from Tymeac, executes the process, and returns the
  output message back to Tymeac.</p>
  <p>Tymeac allows object development to proceed in a concurrent manor.&nbsp;Tymeac allows
  incremental prototyping and development of all tasks simultaneously. The design,
  construction, and testing of objects in a vacuum simplifies the entire
  process.&nbsp;Redesign of the object does not effect other objects and can proceed without
  shutting down the <a href="TyNewCopy.html">system</a>.&nbsp;Since Tymeac allows objects to
  execute as separate threads, the vacuum development environment reflects the real world
  environment.</p>
  <p>Once written and tested, these objects then become part of your repository.&nbsp;Since
  they are Java<sup><small>&#153;</small></sup> objects, and Tymeac itself is a 100% pure
  application, they can run on any hardware, anywhere.&nbsp;See design pattern, <a href="Patterns.html#sharing">Use-Sharing</a>.</p>
  <p>See the <a href="Demo.html">Demonstration System</a>.&nbsp;Each <a href="Develop.html#pap">Processing Application Class</a> is small, single purpose. Getting
  a final result is simply a matter of stringing together the Tymeac <a href="Develop.html#queue">Queues</a> into a Tymeac <a href="Develop.html#function">Function</a>.</p>
  <p>Reuse has become a reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 style="text-align: justify"><a name="failure"></a>Failure Containment</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>See Product description, <a href="../Brochure/Bennies.html#failure">Failure Containment</a></p>
  <p>Failures propagate up the chain.&nbsp;They also propagate sideways, downward, halfway
  in between and around. Anyone who writes programs outside the stand-alone world
  knows this.</p>
  <p>Other industries have means to limit exposure from the harmful:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The nuclear industry has containment vessels to hold the radio active material.</p>
    <p>The biological industry has sealed laboratories to contain the deadly germs.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Until the day comes that computer programs can be 100% thoroughly tested in all
  situations, then a means for isolating code is desirable.</p>
  <p>Tymeac provides the means to isolate the code.&nbsp;Each <a href="Develop.html#pap">Processing
  Application Class</a> is separate from the other Processing Application Classes (see
  pattern, <a href="Patterns.html#mediator">Mediator</a>).&nbsp;Each Processing Application
  Class can fail without affecting any other Processing Application Class. Tymeac
  automatically backs out intermediate component failures when Queues <a href="SchdFail.html">fail to schedule</a>.&nbsp;Tymeac <a href="Develop.html#testing">testing</a>
  is easier than the traditional approach.</p>
  <p>When your Processing Application Class is a front end for Messaging, Data Base, or
  transport mechanisms, then the isolation environment of Tymeac can save your business
  immeasurable hours of debugging.&nbsp;There is no need to sift through extraneous elements
  of the matrix.&nbsp;See also <a href="Benefits.html#gateway">Gateway</a>, below.</p>

<h2>The Web Servides Solution</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>See Product description, <a href="../Brochure/Bennies.html#jini">The Web Service
  Solution</a>.</p>
  <p>The major problem facing application developers in the Web Service environment is that
  they must deal with an asynchronous-process in addition to the networking and proxy
  management of a Jini or UDDI Service.</p>
  <p>Tymeac solves the asynchronous-process, application development problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Reduced Response Times</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>See Product description, <a href="../Brochure/Bennies.html#parallel">Reduced Response
  Times</a>.</p>
  <p>The requirement today is for modularized, functionally isolated code so that the
  hardware, network, and framework can function with parallel processing to significantly
  reduce response times.</p>
  <p>See the <a href="Demo.html">Demonstration System</a>.&nbsp;The Tymeac Functions 1, 3,
  4, 6, and 7 use multiple Tymeac Queues that are active simultaneously.&nbsp;The order of
  completion is irrelevant as well as the order of dispatch.</p>
  <p>See also the <a href="ex1.html">examples</a>. Both these examples use multiple Tymeac
  Queues pulling together to solve the problem.</p>
  <p>For your needs, almost any situation where multiple modules can work on the problem
  without temporal concurrency, parallel processing with Tymeac is available.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Separately Tunable JVM's</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-align: justify">See Product description, <a href="../Brochure/Bennies.html#tunable">Tunable JVM's</a>.</p>
  <p align="justify" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Tymeac Server runs in its own Java Virtual
  Machine, separate from your application Client, Data Base Management System, Jini Service
  or other middle tier layer.&nbsp;This advantage lets you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p align="left">Use separate security property and/or classpath options.&nbsp;You can
      have the same process resident in several JVM's each with its own -Dsecurity.policy.file
      or -classpath.&nbsp; In this way, you can control who does what, where, and when.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Personnel may quickly move the JVM to the most advantageous machine when
      needed. This is as easy as changing a script file and moving it to another machine along
      with the Tymeac class files.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Personnel may add a debugging interface or profiling option. Since each
      JVM is separate, stopping the processing of one does not impact any other.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Personnel may change memory allocation or other non-standard start up
      options.&nbsp;Non-standard options are good for debugging and tuning. However, Sun may not
      support each indefinitely or in the same way. Using a separate JVM gives you the option of
      using what is best now.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

<h2><a name="gateway"></a>Gateway to Distributed Computing</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>See Product description, <a href="../Brochure/Bennies.html#gateway">Gateway</a>.</p>
  <p>Tymeac uses an n-tiered architecture.&nbsp;The <u>Tymeac process</u> is separate from
  the <u>database</u> and the <u>user interface</u>.</p>
  <p>Each Tymeac component process executes as a separate thread. The communication,
  application and database interface dependencies normally found in large, multi-function
  processes do not exist.&nbsp;See pattern, <a href="Patterns.html#adapter">Adapter</a>.</p>
  <p>As Java<sup><small>&#153;</small></sup> expands into transaction processing, the
  Logical Unit of Work (LUW) becomes a factor. A complex process (Tymeac Function) can have
  multiple logical units of work (threads in Tymeac Queues). Each LUW may interface with
  [including the Java Native Interface] and hold locks on, a different resource.</p>
  <p>Physically distributing the work is the key to Distributed Computing.&nbsp;Once the
  work is in separate threads, each independent thread may use any method for transport
  (RMI, CORBA, etc.) to another location.&nbsp;Each thread is in isolation from the other
  threads.&nbsp;This also simplifies testing and debugging, see <a href="Benefits.html#failure">Failure Containment</a>, above.</p>
  <p>The <a href="ex1.html">examples</a>, revalue portfolio, is also an example of how to
  distribute the work.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Ability to Multi-Process</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>See Product description, <a href="../Brochure/Bennies.html#multiprocess">Multi
  Processing</a>.</p>
  <p>Multi Processing is the ability to put different threads on different CPU's within the
  same box.&nbsp;This does not happen by magic.&nbsp;Even FORTRAN must segment the program
  explicitly.</p>
  <p>Separating the work into threads is mandatory.&nbsp;Managing those threads is Tymeac.
  See <a href="Benefits.html#control">Control</a>, above.</p>
  <p>Trying to manage multiple processes in an MPP or SMP environment is difficult.&nbsp;Tymeac manages multiple processes in unique <a href="Develop.html#queue">Queues</a>.
  The developer&nbsp;codes the method without concern for the execution environment.</p>
  <p>Tymeac lets the operating system, Java<sup><small>&#153;</small></sup>, and access
  methods schedule, monitor and control the use of resources by separating complex requests
  into component threads.</p>
  <p>See the <a href="Demo.html">Demonstration System</a>.&nbsp;Any Tymeac Queue can run on
  any CPU and produce the proper result.</p>
