<p>This section is for developers. There is a directory called <b>

them. See also the <a href="InternalStructure.html">internal structure</a>

<p>Testing multi-threaded applications can drive anyone to drink. Modifying Tymeac, without an IDE to single step code, 
is a guarantee to 
failure. Even with a good IDE there are storage areas of interest to developers 
during execution that cannot be displayed by the IDE. (Before object-oriented 
you could get the address of the storage area you needed and go peek at what was 
in memory or get a core dump and spend your life with a hex calculator.) </p>

<p>The client directory contains classes for general purpose. Anyone can look at 
what stage the thread are in, how many of these and those have happened. But 
what we really need to know is the internal status of the environment. That is, 
what does a Queue Area look like, right now. How many sync/async requests are 
active and what are the details of each.</p>

<p>We also have a few quickies to modify the DBMS tables (delete, insert, 
retrieve.) </p>
<blockquote>

<p>TyDBdelete <br>
TyDBinsert<br>
TyDBretrieve</p>

<p>We also have quickies to display and modify the Derby and Hypersonic databases both as an 
embedded database server and a network database server. You can easily modify 
the code to use any other data base management system.</p>

<p><b>In a nutshell, </b> </p>

<p>The Tymeac management modules are all in <b>
com.tymeac.base.</b></p>

<p>Tymeac accepts a client request syncRequest() / asyncRequest()</p>

<p>Tymeac creates a <b>RequestDetail</b> object for the request and saves it in 
the RequestHeader detail list (ConcurrentLinkedQueue.)&nbsp; The purpose of these objects is to hold the information necessary to 
track the request and to recover from exceptions. Each client request returns a 
pointer to the newly created <b>RequestDetail</b> object which is then put into 
a Wait List for pickup by a Queue Thread. When the current request finishes, Tymeac frees the
<b>RequestDetail</b>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To free the object, Tymeac sets the status of the RequestDetail to 64 and removes the RequestDetail from the RequestHeader 
ConcurrentLinkedQueue. This should be the last live reference to the object so 
garbage collection may proceed. Since remove() doesn't remove the element 
immediately, iterating the list may return a freed objects. Eventually, the 
freed objects disappear.</p>

<p>Prior to release 5.3, Tymeac used a home-grown method of managing the 
RequestDetail objects. When each RequestDetail was free, it was reused saving 
allocate/de-allocate overhead. The garbage collection algorithms are so good 
today, the home-grown method is no longer efficient.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The RequestHeader contains methods to iterate the detail list, add and remove 
elements.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>SyncRequest()'s time-out. After a <a href="Monitor.html#sync">very long 
interval,</a> Tymeac will free the RequestDetail.  </p>

<p>AsyncRequest()'s <a href="TyStalled.html">stall </a>and may be manually freed by 
an administrator.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Tymeac places the pointer to the RequestDetail object into a wait 
list (Class AreaWaitList) in each Queue required by the Function. The threads 
retrieve that pointer to process the request. Waitlists arrays for the pointers 
are actually ConcurrentLinkedQueue&lt;RequestDetail&gt;.</p>

<p>Tymeac then MAY inform a thread on each Queue (Class AreaBase) to do the 
work. (When threads finish processing other requests they look in the wait lists 
for more work.)  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Each Queue has one or more threads but they are not the 
traditional &quot;thread pool&quot; type. The Queue contains a Class, 
<a href="InternalStructure.html#areaDetail">AreaThreadMgmt</a>, for each 
thread so Tymeac can manage each thread individually. This is the big difference 
between Tymeac and the concurrent utility Thread Pool classes.  </p>

  <blockquote>

<p>Think of thread 
pools as a pool of sharks swimming around looking for prey. You wouldn't want to 
venture into that pool. Tymeac's Queue Threads are well-behaved, leashed threads 
that fetch prey, consume it and then return to the corral all under the watchful 
eye of the <a href="Monitor.html">Tymeac Monitor</a>.</p>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>When no thread is working, 
Tymeac starts a new thread. </li>
  <li>When a thread is 'waiting for work', Tymeac uses a Condition.signal() to wake up the thread.</li>
  <li>For the steps Tymeac uses to inform 
the thread, see method AreaBase.schedule(). </li>
  <li>For a general discussion on the life 
cycle of threads see <a href="Tuning.html#cycle">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tymeac waits for all the Queues to finish for syncRequest() and passes back 
the Object[] to the caller or returns immediately for asyncRequest().</p>

<p>Additionally, for asyncRequest(), Tymeac may schedule an output agent (new 
asynchronous process) when the original processing completes.</p>

<p>Of concern to developers are the internal arrays Tymeac uses to process the 
requests.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>RequestHeader -- Requests array (anchor point for details)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RequestDetail -- Request data</p>

</blockquote>

<p><b><a name="diag"></a>diagnoseRequest()</b><br>
The&nbsp; main Tymeac interface is TymeacInterface. Implementing that interface is 
TymeacImpl. The implementation contains a method diagnoseRequest(). You can put 
anything in there you want. Naturally, you must also add code to the Tymeac 
classes you want to look at. What is in there now is code to display (System.out.println) 
the contents of the various arrays. These display on the Server window since 
they run in the Server JVM. The clients display an 'ok' message.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>For example: to display all sync requests currently in the system, the client 
fills in the Class TyParm (String, int, int, int) by setting the first two int's 
to 1, 2 respectively. The client calls the Tymeac Server diagnoseRequest() method. The 
diagnoseRequest() calls the RequestHeader object like so:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font SIZE="2" COLOR="#0000c0"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; request_tbl</font><font SIZE="2">.dsplyActiveSyncDetails();</p>

  </font>

<p>diagnoseRequest() returns an OK message to the client. dsply...() prints the 
list of active sync requests on the console window such as:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Total ALL Slots in use =&nbsp; 160, SR Slots in use at first scan = 50, total requests handled = 2000<br>
<b>Next
Detail</b><br>
In=000000000000000000 Na=2 #Q=2 Now=1 Next Output=1 Backout=false Waittime=20000 
Status=1</p>

</blockquote>

<p>What this means for a sync request is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Total slots</b> is the total RequestDetail objects in the RequestHeader 
  ConcurrentLinkedQueue. These are the Sync, Async and the freed objects mentioned 
  above (status=64.)</li>
  <li><b>Total requests handled</b> is just that.</li>
  <li>...I<b>n use at first scan</b> is the total busy details Tymeac found by 
  enumerating the number busy. Since there is no locking, when Tymeac prints the 
  busy elements (below) the number may change.</li>
  <li>When the count is zero, Tymeac says so and terminates. Otherwise Tymeac 
  prints each busy detail. Tymeac starts at the beginning of the array and 
  prints each busy entry as it finds it. Since there is no locking, the number 
  of printed entries may not match the above first scan number.</li>
  <li><b>Next Detail</b> is just a marker between details.</li>
  <li><b>&nbsp;In=</b> is the input to the request using method: toString().</li>
  <li><b>Na=</b> is the sequence number of this request starting at one (1).</li>
  <li><b>#Q=</b> is the total number of Queues for this request.</li>
  <li><b>Now=</b> is the number of Queues still to process. If the total is 3 
  and Now= 1, then two finished and one is remaining.</li>
  <li><b>Next output=</b> is the next available subscript to put a return object 
  from a Queue Thread. The return of your Processing Application Class may be an 
  object. Tymeac saves all the objects from all the Queues in the request and 
  returns that array to the client. Tymeac puts the return object into an array 
  of objects using an AtomicInteger starting at zero (0). Next Output is that 
  integer. For the above, the integer is 1. This means that element 0 was used 
  and 1 is next.</li>
  <li><b>Backout=</b> true, the request timed-out or was cancelled. false 
  otherwise.</li>
  <li><b>Waittime=</b> The time in milliseconds this request will wait for all 
  Queues to finish.</li>
  <li><b>Status=</b> This is an integer. See RequestDetail for the values. (1 is 
  busy)&nbsp; </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Remember</b> -- Tymeac does not use locking to gather this information. 
The in-use-at-first-scan may be one and two details may print or no details may 
print or anything else. Even the information contained in each detail may have 
changed since it was fetched and printed.</p>

<p>Displaying this information for an active system may be useless. We use it 
when we think there are timed-out requests or when the system is quiet and we 
use the <a href="TyOverall.html">Overall_Display</a> and it says there are 
active (a)sync requests. So, we run this diagnoseRequest() to see what is going on. </p>

<p>To use the supplied clients, duplicate any of the supplied client access scripts and change the class to 
execute from com.tymeac.demo... to com.tymeac.test.?? where ?? is as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>

<p>TyDisplayAreaAAAA (AAAA - DDDD and Notify) these are the supplied 
demonstration Queues Alter these as necessary for your own Queues.</p>

<p>TyDisplay??table -- Where ?? is AR for the async RequestDetail elements, SR for the sync 
RequestDetail elements 
and STALL for the <a href="Stalled.html">stall array</a>.</p>

<p>TyDisplayFUNCtable -- To display the current functions. (similar to the 
client display but displays all the functions in the system)</p>

<p>TyDisplayFUNCques -- To display the current functions with their queue names.</p>

<p>You can add anything you like here without impacting Tymeac.</p>
