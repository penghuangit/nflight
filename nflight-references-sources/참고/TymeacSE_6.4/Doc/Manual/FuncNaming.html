<h1>Function Naming</h1>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>What names are best for the Tymeac Functions.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every request for Tymeac Server requires a Function name look up.&nbsp;This is the
  problem.</p>
  <p>Since the Function name is a String, comparing the entered Function name against an
  array of Strings is very inefficient.&nbsp;The String.compareTo() method compares one
  character at a time.&nbsp;Another means is preferable. Hash code?</p>
  <p>Problems with hash codes:<ul>
    <li><p align="left">String.hashCode() does not always produce a unique integer, especially
      for Strings greater than 15 characters.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">The hash index (array.length % String.hashCode() ) seldom produces a
      unique bucket number considering the traditional composition of most Function names (more
      on this below.)</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Given the above two points, most Function name look ups using a
      Hashtable/Map would produce a search through a linked list. This is a serious performance
      issue.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>To illustrate point two:&nbsp;The composition of Function names traditionally follows a
  similar grouping.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Functions for the Accounts Receivable Department are called: AccountsReceivable_1 -
    33.&nbsp; Likewise for the Widget manufacturing section, WidgetTopper_1 - 45,
    WidgetButton_1 - 55, etc. The composition is usually an identifier with trailing digits.</p>
  <p>This traditional composition is the basis for the Tymeac Demonstration Function names:
  Function_1 - 8.&nbsp;Although these names produce a unique hash code, (-916106530 through
  -916106523), they all fall into bucket number 11, ([array.length to the next prime] 11 %
  hashCode() ).</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h2 style="text-align: justify">Solution</h2>

<blockquote>
  <h3 style="text-align: justify">Part I</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Tymeac Server uses four different search algorithms depending on the number of
    Functions (low and high) and whether it can use hash codes or not. (The definition of 
    low is a single digit
    (&lt;10) number of Functions; high is all others.) </p>
    <p>All low number of Functions use a serial (linear) search. The array is unordered.&nbsp;Tymeac looks at each entry until
    it finds an equal or the end of the array.</p>
    <p>High uses a binary search.&nbsp;The array is sorted.&nbsp;Tymeac limits the area to
    search by halving.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Serial, using a hash code for comparisons.</li>
        <li>Serial, using a String for comparisons.</li>
        <li>Binary, using a hash code for comparisons.</li>
        <li>Binary, using a String for comparisons.</li>
      </ol>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Part II</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The second part of the solution involves how the compare takes place. As mentioned
    above, String.compareTo() is slow.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Tymeac Server builds a hash code (String.hashCode() ) array of all the
    Function names and uses this for the compare.&nbsp;This is only possible when there are no
    duplicate hash codes.&nbsp;When there are duplicates, then Tymeac Server uses the String
    compare methods. During start up, if Tymeac cannot use a hash code, it 
    writes a message to the console and log.</p>
    <p>For peak performance, it is the responsibility of the name-maker to chose Function
    names that compute to unique hash codes.</p>
    <p>This is not as difficult as it may seem.&nbsp;Tymeac Function names are internal to the
    processing.&nbsp;They are not input by people at workstations, where they would have to be
    easily understood.&nbsp;The Function names may be short and cryptic.</p>
    <p>We make this task easier for the name-maker by including a source code <a href="Samples.html#utility">sample</a> class to check both the User Class Functions and
    the DBMS Functions, <strong>FunctionChecker</strong>.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This class is especially useful for the User Class Functions.&nbsp;The DBMS can check
      for duplicate names and other checks. The User Class Functions, since customers maintain
      these by hand, can easily have problems.</p>
      <p>In addition to checking the validity of either (your option) the DBMS or User Class
      Functions, this class also checks for duplicate hash codes and reports its findings.</p>
      <p>One possible way to use this class is to develop Function names according to a general
      standard.&nbsp; Run the class against your Function names.&nbsp;If there are any duplicate
      hash codes, then rename only those Function names that are necessary.</p>
