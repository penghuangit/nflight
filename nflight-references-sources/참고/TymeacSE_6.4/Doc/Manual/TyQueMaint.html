    <p>For the majority of cases, the system default is sufficient.&nbsp;If the need arises,

    the time this Class begins executing.&nbsp; When that time exceeds this value, then Tymeac
    marks the thread in which this class is executing as &quot;cancelled&quot;.&nbsp;When next
    the Monitor runs, it marks the thread as &quot;disabled.&quot;&nbsp;If the thread resumes
    processing, the thread resets the entry, irrespective of any prior setting.&nbsp;These
    status codes have to do with scheduling. A thread with a status of &quot;cancelled or
    disabled&quot; may not participate in scheduling.</p>
    <p>When all threads have a status of &quot;cancelled or disabled&quot;, then the Queue is

    <p>Enabling disabled threads brings up another issue. Perhaps the 
    application is taking a really long time. Perhaps it will continue 
    eventually. When an administrator &quot;enables&quot; the disabled threads in a Queue, 
    that person is declaring the hanging threads expunged. If the thread 
    eventually continues execution and determines it was expunged, it terminates 
    immediately without completing the request. A terminating expunged thread does 
    write a message to the log and console (<a href="MsgTy06.html">Normal</a>,

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This is a fixed number for all Wait Lists in this Queue.&nbsp;Multiply this number by
    the total number of Wait Lists for the total available entries for the Queue. 
    This number is dynamically alterable in the <a href="TyQueData.html">Queue 
    Data</a> GUI/non-GUI.</p>
    <p>There are two problems with Wait Lists.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
      <p align="left">There is a FIFO problem. When an overflow occurs, Tymeac puts the 
      request into the next Wait List that has a free slot. (E.G. Wait List 1 is 
      full, the request goes into Wait List 2.) Tymeac processes requests in 
      Wait Lists from the first onward. Therefore, when a slot opens in Wait 
      List 1, a new priority 1 request goes in Wait List 1. That means this new request 
      will process before the previous request that overflowed into Wait List 2.</li>
      <li>
      <p align="left">When the Wait Lists are used as priority lists, then the above FIFO 
      problem may become a priority inversion problem if there were pending 
      requests already in Wait List 2 (the new request goes in after the other 
      requests in the list.)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Tymeac's answer to the above problems is to have the <u>physical</u> 
    number of elements in each Wait List as large as feasible. The Queue adds 
    elements by chaining a new Node object to the list. Therefore, there is no 
    memory overhead by specifying this number large. Making the number large 
    avoids overflow exceptions. Bounding Wait Lists prevents an out of memory 
    error.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>When there is a problem with processing, the number of pending requests 
    back up. A 'no wait list available' condition is preferable to an out of 
    memory error.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Therefore, make this number as large as practical so that overflows only 
    occur when there is truly a problem with processing.</p>
    <p>A large number of <u>physical</u> slots would invalidate the use of 
    thresholds. Therefore, we also have <u>logical</u> slots.</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p><strong><a name="nbr_slots_logical"></a>Number of <u>Logical</u> Entries in Each Wait List</strong> --&nbsp; Minimum one.&nbsp;This is
  the number of entries or slots in each Wait List for Threshold processing.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Default: </b>Same as <u>physical</u> entries. Therefore, you need to 
    enter a number here.</p>
    <p>This is a fixed number for all Wait Lists in this Queue. 
    This number is dynamically alterable in the <a href="TyQueData.html">Queue 
    Data</a> GUI/non-GUI.</p>
    <p>As noted above, a large number of <u>physical</u> slots in Wait Lists 
    helps overcome FIFO errors but makes thresholds unusable.</p>
    <p><u>Logical</u> entries are the number of entries Tymeac considers for 
    threshold processing only. Think of <u>logical</u> as the normal top load on 
    a Queue.</p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>A Queue should not have more then 20 requests pending at any time. Make 
    the <u>logical</u> size 20 and to be extra, extra safe, make the <u>physical</u> 
    size 60.</p>
    <p>When not using priority Wait Lists we could have two Wait Lists with a 
    physical number of slots at what we believe to be the maximum number of 
    pending requests on this Queue plus 20% more just in case. </p>
    <p>If there is a temporary problem and requests back up more then this 
    limit, then request overflow into the second Wait List. This may cause a 
    FIFO error but it is better then rejecting new requests. If the problem is 
    not temporary, then both Wait Lists fill up and new requests reject.</p>
    <p>We can still use thresholds since we can set the <u>logical</u> entries 
    at what we believe to be normal maximum number of pending requests.</p>
    <p>We could have a single Wait List with double the physical slots but we 
    would not get statistics for the number of times the pending requests 
    exceeded a limit. Tymeac keeps a high water mark on each Wait List but that 
    doesn't say how many times the pending requests got there. Tymeac keeps 
    statistics on overflows.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Total number of Wait Lists and number of <u>physical</u> and <u>logical</u> 
    slots in each Wait List, are dependent upon the application.&nbsp;See the discussion

    <p>Tymeac supports requests overflowing from one Wait List to the next as 
    the best way <u><i>not</i></u> to reject a request. If it doesn't fit exactly where you 
    want it and there is a place anywhere to put it, then put it there. It may 
    not be exactly where you want it, but it's close. The alternative is to 
    reject any request that tries to put a request in a full Wait List. And 
    since Tymeac is an open source product, you can alter the code to your 
    satisfaction.</p>
    <p>With overflows FIFO errors are possible but FIFO errors are inherent with 
    all priority queues. Tymeac tries to limit this possibility with the large 
    number of <a href="#nbr_slots">physical Wait List slots</a>.</p>
    <p>However, overflows should not regularly 
    occur. They are <u>handled</u> <u>exceptions</u>. Tymeac keeps track of the high water mark 
    for each Wait List. The high water mark statistic is available on the
    <a href="TyWlData.html">Wait List Display GUI</a> and on the 
    <a href="Stats.html">Statistics</a>. The high water 
    mark statistic should help you keep overflows low. There is a balance 
    between the number of <u>physical</u> slots in each Wait List 
    and how you wish to use Thresholds -- the number of <u>

    slots in each Wait List</a>.</p>
    <p>We think Wait Lists are a 
    far better choice over packaged classes. Usually standard Priority Queues 
    need to lock the Queue for processing (Tymeac is lock-free) and they resolve duplicate priority elements arbitrarily. Dealing with the FIFO error 
    is difficult and sometimes messy (see the FIFO example in java.util.concurrent.PriorityBlockingQueue.)</p>

    <p>One may not consider Wait Lists priority Wait Lists. You may use only two Wait Lists.
    One as a primary and a second in the event the primary is <u>physically</u> full.</p>

<p><a name="theory"></a>Theory of the Weighted Average:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Priority Wait Lists requirements are not always obvious. Consider the requirement that
  the Queue requires Wait Lists for High, Medium and Low priorities. Using:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Wait List 1 for High,<br>
    Wait List 2 for Medium,<br>
    Wait List 3 for Low,<br>
    Wait List 4 for Just in case.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>seems like a workable solution. However, for this situation, the reality is 
  that requests come into this Queue in bursts.&nbsp;High requests may overflow into 
  Medium. Tymeac processes the High Wait List first making slots available. Then 
  more High requests come in. The new High requests go into the High Wait List 
  and will process before the old High requests that spilled into the Medium 
  Wait List. This is a priority inversion error.</p>
  <p>Therefore, the structure could be the following:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Wait List 1 for High, with 2 and 3 for overflow,<br>
    Wait List 4 for Medium, with 5 and 6 for overflow,<br>
    Wait List 7 for Low, with 8 and 9 for overflow,<br>
    Wait List 10 and 11 for Just in case.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The multiple overflow Wait Lists are for keeping detail account of the load on each
  group.&nbsp;Instead of having the High Wait List overflow into a Medium Wait List, or,
  having a single overflow Wait List for each group, multiple overflow Wait Lists, with a
  smaller number of <u>physical</u> Wait List entries in each, provide more detail on usage. It&nbsp; 
  doesn't solve the FIFO error, but it helps. The best solution is to make the 
  number of <u>physical</u> slots in Wait Lists high enough to avoid overflows.</p>
  <p>With this structure:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>
  <strong>Overall Percent</strong> considers all the Wait Lists and is not usable.</p>
  <p>
  <strong>Individual Percent</strong> has limited usability; the logical and 
  physical number of slots needs to be close.&nbsp;With the smaller number of <u>
  physical</u> entries in each Wait List, an overflow activates a new thread too 
  often.</p>
  <p> <strong>Weighted Average</strong> considers only those Wait Lists that are
  currently in use, with a <strong>Weighted Factor</strong>, and, the number of threads
  currently working the Queue.</p>
