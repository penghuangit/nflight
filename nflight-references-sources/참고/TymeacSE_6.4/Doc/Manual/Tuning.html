  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Tuning is a full time job for professionals and involves every parameter 
    of the operating system, Java, applications, and network.</p>
    <p>This section is not a how to tune manual, but a what does Tymeac do, and 
    therefore, what should I look for in tuning. Two parameters, applicable to 
    Tymeac, are: <a href="#threads">Threads</a> and <a href="#waitlists">Wait Lists</a>.</p>

  <p>Tymeac runs on all processors that support Java. The RMI Servers run on all 
  processors that support RMI . However, not all RMI
  Servers work identically on all platforms for all releases of  RMI or operating
  systems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tymeac <a href="ThreadMgmt.html">manages threads</a>.&nbsp;Tymeac handles the synchronization, deadlock avoidance,
  blocking - runnable tasks for threads.&nbsp;Tymeac insulates the Tymeac Client from thread
  management.</p>
  <p>The Queue Maintenance Class (<a href="TyQueMaint.html">TyQueMaint</a>) or User Classes
  (<a href="UserQueues.html">TyUserQueues</a>) defines the number of threads for each Queue.</p>
  <p>Tymeac <u>may</u> start all threads for a Queue at Tymeac start up when<a href="TyQueMaint.html#start"> indicated</a>. Otherwise, Tymeac instantiates and starts
  each thread when necessary.</p>
  <p><a name="pool"></a>Tymeac differs from the traditional thread pool in its ability to 
  thoroughly
  control the threading environment.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Three big problems with basic thread pools are:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. When to start/terminate a thread. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. How to control how many threads are executing at any one time.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. How to determine when a thread stalls.</p>
    <p>Let's say there are three threads in a pool.<ol>
      <li>Normally you start all three threads at system startup. The threads remain alive until
        the system shuts down. Each Java thread usually maps to an operating system thread. During light
        activity for the queue, there is no way to reduce the load on the total system.</li>
    </ol>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The other way is to start each thread when you put a request into a queue (lazy
      initialization) up until the maximum. Each thread reduces the load on the queue until
      there is no more work, at which time it terminates. While this reduces the thread load on
      the system, it results in a large thread create/destroy overhead for a heavily used
      system.</p>
    <p><b><em style="font-style: normal">Tymeac solves this problem with lazy initialization and the ability to reuse or
    selectively terminate threads during light activity.</em></b></blockquote>
    <ol start="2">
      <li>The threads block until there is work. If there is one request in the
        queue, then one thread is working and the other two are blocking. When there are three or
        more requests in the queue, then all threads are working.<br>
        <br>
        There is no way to control the number of threads working when there is more than one
        request in the queue. When a thread can process a request in a short time period, then
        using more than one thread for a light load is a waste of resources. Additionally, since
        threads compete with each other for cycles, storage etc., unnecessary threads may slow
        down the overall throughput.</li>
    </ol>
    <blockquote>
    <p><b><em style="font-style: normal">Tymeac solves this problem with the <u>inactive status</u> and new thread
    thresholds (see below).</em></b></blockquote>
    <ol start="3">
      <li>When problems arise in a thread (deadlocks, exceptions, errors), the thread stalls. That
        is, it cannot continue executing without intervention. There is no way to internally
        determine when a deadlock is present. There is no automatic error recovery and restart.
        The best one can hope for is that someone notices that the work is not getting done.</li>
    </ol>
    <blockquote>
    <p><b><em style="font-style: normal">Tymeac solves this problem by timing each status in the life of a thread,
    automatically recovering whenever possible and notifying administrators when there is a
    hard stall.</em></b></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the Thread Pool... Classes in java.util.concurrent address the first 
  problem, they don't handle problems two and three. Additionally, they don't 
  adequately deal with priority queues and thresholds.</p>
  <hr color="#000000" width="60%">
  <p>A thread waits (blocks) until it is needed (runnable).&nbsp;When necessary, Tymeac gets
  a new instance of the thread (i.e. allocated) and starts() it.&nbsp;Active and inactive
  are Tymeac thread <a href="TyQueThd.html#status">status codes</a>.&nbsp;Initially, all
  threads are <u>inactive</u>.</p>
  <p>Tymeac first <a href="TyQueMaint.html#activate">activates a thread</a> when there is
  work for the Queue.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a thread has no work it enters a status of <u>Waiting for work</u>.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If a new request comes into the Queue, then Tymeac notifies the first thread with this
    status that there is work.&nbsp;The thread's status becomes <u>Notified, awaiting
    execution</u>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As soon as Java time slices the thread it changes its status to <u>Thread
    processing</u>. Since every request goes into a Wait List, this newly notified thread may
    not be the thread to process the request.&nbsp;Any currently working thread in the Queue
    may fetch the request. In any case, when the thread has no work it re-enters a status of <u>Waiting
    for work</u>.</p>
    <p>When the time for waiting expires (the Wait Time Element in Queue Maintenance <a href="TyQueMaint.html#waitime">TyQueMaint</a>) the thread sets its status to <u>Inactive</u>.&nbsp;The
    thread is alive but blocking and is no longer participating in scheduling until
    reactivated as a result of a Threshold exception, below.&nbsp;(The Tymeac Monitor may
    destroy a thread after its <a href="TyQueMaint.html#kill">Idle Thread Life</a> time
    expires.)</p>
    <p>See the full <a href="Tuning.html#cycle">life cycle</a> of a thread, below.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tymeac always reactivates a thread when there is an overflow in the wait lists. An
  overflow is when the request does not fit into the desired wait list because that wait
  list is full and the request must go into the next, higher wait list.</p>
  <p>The New Thread Thresholds (<a href="TyQueMaint.html#threshold">TyQueMaint</a>) describes the
  algorithms used in determining when Tymeac may reactivate a thread when there is no
  overflow. However, not expounded there is the threshold scan delay.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><a name="scan"></a>The threshold scan delay is a two second delay Tymeac uses between
    starting a new thread and next scanning the wait lists for threshold values. This delay is
    to avoid unnecessarily starting too many threads when there is a flood of requests. For
    example:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Let's say the individual threshold percent for a Queue is 60%. Therefore, when the
      number of pending requests in a wait list exceeds 60%, Tymeac starts a new thread.</p>
      <p>Currently the load on the Queue is 50% but then a burst of requests comes in increasing
      the load well past 60%. Tymeac starts a new thread when the first new request exceeds 60%
      but does not scan the wait lists again for two seconds. This gives the newly started
      thread a chance to reduce the load before more threads enter the system.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The scan delay value is system wide, not part of each individual Queue. This is because
    of the fact that sometimes too many variables makes tuning a nightmare, especially across
    multiple operating systems.<br>
    See below, in <a href="#waitlists">Wait Lists</a> (fixed
    number of entries within each Queue). <br>
    See also the Monitor (<a href="Disabled.html#nb">interval
    of the timed events</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a name="mat"></a><strong>M</strong>aximum <strong>A</strong>ctive <strong>T</strong>hreads
  gives little warning of a problem.&nbsp;This is not the total number of threads defined
  within Java but the total number of threads within Java <u>actively</u> <u>processing</u>&nbsp;
  <strong>MAT</strong> is our way of saying the processor is out of gas.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Threads, whether operating system threads or logical threads, compete with each other
  within a Tymeac Queue, with other threads in Java, and with other processes in the
  Box.&nbsp;Sometimes adding more threads slows down overall processing because of resource
  limits (memory, cycle, network, locks, blocking, etc.) </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hence, there is a very close correlation between the number of threads for each Queue
  and the <strong>M</strong>aximum <strong>A</strong>ctive <strong>T</strong>hreads for the
  system.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the purpose of inactivating a Tymeac thread.&nbsp;While <u>Inactive</u>, and
  alive, the thread is not looking for work and Java does not time slice the
  thread.&nbsp;Tymeac Scheduling does not directly select an I<u>nactive</u> thread for a
  client request.&nbsp;Therefore, the thread uses a minimum of resources and does not
  compete with other threads.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>An <strong>example</strong> is helpful.</p>
</blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p>A Queue has three threads.&nbsp;These we will call, #0, #1, and #2.</p>

    activates thread #0.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>More, and more, and more requests come in for this Queue. Tymeac places the requests
    into Wait Lists.&nbsp;Thread #0 processes these requests, without competition from other
    threads.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>As the Wait Lists fill up, Tymeac checks the New Thread Thresholds for this
    Queue.&nbsp;When the Queue exceeds a threshold, Tymeac activates thread #1.</p>

    <p>More, and more, and more requests come in for this Queue.&nbsp;Tymeac places the

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>As the Wait Lists become empty and the threads are no longer busy, the threads wait for
    new work.&nbsp; The status is <u>Waiting for Work</u>.&nbsp;Waiting threads no longer look
    for work themselves. They are blocking.&nbsp;These waiting threads never get time sliced
    until the Tymeac Scheduler notifies them (runnable).</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>When new requests come in, Tymeac notifies the first thread in the list, thread #0. As
    long as thread #0 finishes its work before a new request comes in then Tymeac never
    notifies thread #1.&nbsp;Thread #0 waits and Tymeac notifies it again.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>When the Wait Time expires, thread #1 becomes <u>inactive</u>.&nbsp;A threshold
    exception must take place before thread #1 can participate again.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>As more, and more, and more requests come in for this Queue.&nbsp;Tymeac places the
    requests into Wait Lists. Thread #0 processes these requests, without competition from
    other threads.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>When the Wait Lists are empty and no new requests come in, then thread #0's Wait Time
    expires and it becomes<u> inactive</u>.&nbsp;When the next request comes in, Tymeac
    reactivates thread #0.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The <a href="TyQueMaint.html#kill">Idle Thread Life</a> parameter in the Queue
  determines when the Tymeac Monitor destroys a thread. Specifying a time of zero ignores
  this parameter. Otherwise, when the the thread remains <u>inactive</u> for &quot;Idle
  Thread Life&quot; seconds, the Tymeac Monitor, <u>when next it runs</u>, destroys the
  thread.</p>

    <p>The <u>Number
    of Waits</u> is the number of time-outs (i.e., wait interval expired with no new
    work.)&nbsp;The thread sets its status to <u>Waiting for work</u>, and issues a
    wait.&nbsp;If Tymeac notifies (<u>Number Notified</u>) the thread at anytime before the wait interval expires then
    there is no time-out.</p>
    <p>When the <u>Number Notified</u> is significantly lower than the <u>Number

    <p><b>Number Instantiated<br>
    </b>The <u>Number Instantiated</u> is the total new instances of a thread.&nbsp;This number
    is only significant when taken together with the interval the Tymeac Server is executing.
    For example, if the number is 3,000 and the interval for the Tymeac Server is three (3)
    days, then this is good.&nbsp;However, if the interval is three (3) hours, then the Queue

      thread exceeds one of these time limits, the Tymeac Monitor changes its status to <u>Cancelled</u>.&nbsp;On
      the next cycle of the Tymeac Monitor, all <u>Cancelled</u> threads are set to <u>Disabled</u>.</p>
      <p>These <u>Cancelled</u> or <u>Disabled</u> status codes have no effect on the
      thread.&nbsp;If a thread is just slow, then it changes its own status according to its
      processing.</p>
      <p>These status codes have an effect on scheduling an <u>Inactive</u> thread.&nbsp;Recall
      from above, that when new work comes in, the <u>Inactive</u> thread may only participate
      in processing when:</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>There are no other threads working in the Queue,</li>
        <li>the placement of a request into a Wait List results in an overflow, or</li>
        <li>a Wait List exceeds a Threshold limit.</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><u>Cancelled</u> or <u>Disabled</u> status code threads are not considered working nor
      are they considered available to activate. Therefore, they are non-participants in the
      Queue.</p>
      <p>Consider the following:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>A Queue has three threads.&nbsp;These we will call, #0, #1, and #2.</p>
        <p>When the first request comes in for this Queue, Tymeac places it in a Wait List and
        activates thread #0.</p>
        <p>The Processing Application Class develops a 'hanging' problem for which it never
        recovers. It may be waiting for another resource to become available, etc.</p>
        <p>Tymeac considers this thread &quot;working&quot;.&nbsp;As any new requests comes in,
        Tymeac places the request in a Wait List.&nbsp;As long as no overflow occurs or no
        Threshold limit exceeds, then it is reasonable to assume that thread #0 will process the
        new request when it finishes with the current one.&nbsp; Therefore, Tymeac does not
        activate a new thread.</p>
        <p>Thread #0 exceeds a time limit.&nbsp;The Tymeac Monitor sets the status to Cancelled.
        If the request thread #0 is working on is an Asynchronous Request, the Tymeac Monitor
        places an entry in the <a href="Stalled.html">Stall Array</a> for this request.</p>
        <p>As any new requests comes in, Tymeac places the request in a Wait List.&nbsp; Since no
        threads are considered &quot;Working&quot;, Tymeac activates thread #1.&nbsp; As long as
        thread #1 does not 'hang' as well, it processes the requests normally.</p>
        <p>On the next cycle of the Tymeac Monitor, it sets the status of thread #0 to Disabled
        and may send a message to the <a href="TyNotify.html">Notification</a> Queue.</p>

<h3><a name="waitlists"></a><strong>Wait Lists </strong></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each Queue must have at least one Wait List.&nbsp;The Queue Maintenance Class (<a href="TyQueMaint.html#waitlist">TyQueMaint</a>) or User Classes (<a href="UserQueues.html">TyUserQueues</a>)
  defines the number of Wait Lists and number of 
  <a href="TyQueMaint.html#nbr_slots">physical</a> and
  <a href="TyQueMaint.html#nbr_slots_logical">logical</a> entries available in each Wait
  List.&nbsp;All Wait Lists use FIFO processing. Tymeac Server, when activating a new
  thread, always puts the request into a Wait List. This is so that the first thread looking
  for work may process the request rather than making the request wait for the new thread
  to become active.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The request (<a href="TymeacParm.html">TymeacParm</a>)
  specifies the priority of the request. Tymeac puts it into its respective Wait List.&nbsp;Priority 3 goes
  into Wait List 3, Priority 1 goes into Wait List 1. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wait Lists may not be priority lists.&nbsp;Using two or more Wait Lists when the
  request always specifies priority 1 is an overflow technique. See the 
  discussion in the Queue Maintenance Class (<a href="TyQueMaint.html#example">TyQueMaint</a>) 
  for how to use these Wait Lists and the problems of such.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tymeac attempts to put the request into the Wait List corresponding to its
  priority.&nbsp;However, when that Wait List is full, Tymeac puts the request into the next
  higher Wait List. This is a primary overflow.&nbsp;When that Wait List is also full,
  Tymeac puts the request into the next higher Wait List.&nbsp;This is a secondary overflow. 
  Overflows are handled errors.</p>
  <p><a name="all"></a>All Wait Lists for a Queue have a fixed number of entries taken from
  the Queue Maintenance Class. Using a variable number for each Wait List makes tuning
  extremely difficult.</p>
  <p>Circumstances change day to day. In reality, nobody monitors any system with extreme diligence. Using a
  variable number of entries for each Wait List means that similar Queues may not reflect
  similar behavior.&nbsp;When conditions change, the algorithm for determining what is a
  problem must be unique for the number of entries factor. The fixed number makes the
  calculation simple, affords an  at-a-glance picture with numbers and charts, and a
  meaningful assumption about similar Queues is possible.</p>
  <p>See also the <a href="Disabled.html#nb">note</a> in the discussion of Disabled Queues.</p>
  <p>The Queue Elements Display/Alter Class (<a href="TyQueData.html">TyQueData</a>) permits
  modifying the number of entries in Wait Lists during execution.&nbsp;This gives 
  you another tool with which to tune performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <a href="Stats.html">statistics</a> show the high water mark, primary and secondary overflows at Shut
  Down and On Request. Each Wait List is listed starting at 1:</p>

  <blockquote>

<p><b>Times Used</b><br>
Just what it says.</p>

<p><b>Highest Used</b><br>
High water mark for number of pending requests at any time. When this number is 
close to the <a href="TyQueMaint.html#nbr_slots">physical</a> number of entries 
in a Wait List, then it may be time to increase the physical number of slots.</p>

<p><b>Times Reset</b><br>
During a back-out as the result of a scheduling failure, time-out or cancel -- 
the number of requests removed from this Wait List.</p>

<p><b>Times overflowed primary</b><br>
When a request does not fit in the desired Wait List, it overflows into the next 
Wait List. Overflow is a handled error. If this number is high, make the
<a href="TyQueMaint.html#nbr_slots">physical</a> number of entries in the Wait 
List higher.</p>

<p><b>Times overflowed secondary</b><br>
When a request does not fit in the desired Wait List, it overflows into the next 
Wait List. However, when that Wait List is also full, the request overflows into 
a subsequent Wait List. Overflow is a handled error. If this number is high, 
then the <a href="TyQueMaint.html#nbr_slots">physical</a> number of entries in 
the Wait List is much too low.</p>

  </blockquote>

<p>One may use the statistics to observe a trend before it becomes a problem 
  (high water mark.) One may
  increase or decrease the number of Wait Lists and/or entries available for Wait Lists.</p>

<p>See also the Queue statistics for balancing the number of
<a href="TyQueMaint.html#nbr_slots_logical">logical</a> slots in Wait Lists:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Total times reached Overall Threshold</li>
    <li>Total times reached Individual Threshold</li>
    <li>Total times reached Weighted Average Threshold</li>
