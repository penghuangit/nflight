<h1>Data Base Management System</h1>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This section describes the DBMS requirements for the Tymeac System.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>A relational database is necessary to permanently store the Tymeac <a href="Definitions.html#function">Functions</a> and <a href="Definitions.html#queue">Queues</a>
  for use in your systems, as well as the optional <a href="RunTime.html#stats">Statistics</a>
  and <a href="RunTime.html#log">Log</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tymeac uses the JDBC methods to communicate with this database, therefore, you must
  install the necessary driver for this database.</p>
  <p>Tymeac only supports one DBMS per session. If you want the Functions and 
  Queues to be in one DBMS and the Log and/or Statistics Repository in another 
  DBMS, then file a request for an enhancement. You may have the Log and/or 
  Statistics Repository in a local file or in a user defined class (where you 
  can support another DBMS yourself.)</p>
  <p><a name="embedded"></a><b>Embedded databases.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Tymeac supports the Derby data base both as a network server and as an 
  embedded data base. Derby is part of the Apache Derby project and may be 
  downloaded from the apache.org website. We define the steps necessary to use 
  Derby in a <a href="Derby.html">separate document</a>.</p>
  <p>Tymeac supports the Hsql data base both as a network server and as an 
  embedded data base. Hsql may be 
  downloaded from the hsqldb.org website. We define the steps necessary to use 
  Hsql in a <a href="Hsql.html">separate document</a>.</p>
  <p>By no means are these the only databases for using Tymeac. Tymeac was 
  originally built using DB2, so that works just fine too. Since Tymeac is open 
  source, we choose two open source databases that work both as a network server and 
  as an embedded server.</p>
  <p><b><a name="embedShut"></a>Embedded database shutdown:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>You normally shutdown network databases when they are no longer necessary 
  for anyone to access. Embedded databases should be shut down before the JVM 
  exits so that checkpoints, etc. may be taken.</p>
  <p>Tymeac cannot know what type of database you have and so Tymeac cannot 
  supply code to shut it down gracefully when Tymeac closes. Therefore, we 
  provide a hook, at the very end of Tymeac execution, for you to add your own code.</p>
  <p>You specify the Class you want Tymeac to instantiate at Tymeac shutdown as 
  a command line option:</p>
    <blockquote>
  <p>
    <b>-edbsd</b> followed by your fully qualified Class name for shut down. 
  Such as:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -edbsd com.tymeac.serveruserDerbyEmbeddedShutdown</p>
    </blockquote>
  <p>When set, Tymeac will instantiate your Class exactly the same as with a
    <a href="UserExits.html">user exit</a>. That is, the class must have a 
  no-argument constructor where you put the code you want to execute. The class 
  name must be fully qualified (com.tymeac, etc) and may have URL's, see the <a href="ClassNameFormat.html">naming and URL</a> document.</p>
  <p>Tymeac instantiates this Class at the end of Tymeac shut down just before starting the
    <a href="Shutdown.html#shuthread">shut down thread</a> (when required.) This 
  is, after executing any optional, stage-2 shut down Classes and writing the 
  system statistics. Tymeac logging is no longer active. You may print on the console window (it's your code 
  to do that.) If your code hangs for any reason, then Tymeac will not start the 
  shut down thread. This is the <a href="UserExits.html#hang">same condition as 
  for user exits.</a></p>
  <p>We supply two examples for this in the /serveruser directory:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; com.tymeac.serveruser.DerbyEmbeddedShutdown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; com.tymeac.serveruser.HsqlEmbeddedShutdown</p>

  <h3>Definitions</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Queue Table is defined <a href="DBMSQue.html">here</a>.
    <font color="#FF0000">New column in release 6.0.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Function Table is defined <a href="DBMSFunc.html">here</a>.&nbsp; The List of
    Queues for each Function is defined <a href="DBMSList.html">here</a>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Statistics Table is defined <a href="DBMSStats.html">here</a>.
    <font color="#FF0000">Column name changes in release 5.1.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Log Table is defined <a href="DBMSLog.html">here</a>.&nbsp;
    <font color="#FF0000">Column name changes in release 5.1.</font></p>
    <p><b>The tables are pre-defined for easy insertion. Look in the /scripts/sql 
    directory.</b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Maintenance</h3>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Tymeac locates these tables by String names in the <a href="TyCfg.html">Configuration
    File</a>.</p>
    <p>The Queue Table is maintained <a href="TyQueMaint.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p>The Function and List Tables are maintained <a href="TyFuncMaint.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Tymeac does not provide standard maintenance functions for the optional tables. 
    Sorting, printing, merging, purging, etc. are unique for each customer. 
    However, there are simple utilities in the <b>com.tymeac.test</b> directory 
    that customer's can alter for their use.</p>
