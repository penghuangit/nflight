<h1>Tymeac Shut Down</h1>

        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="Images/divider.gif" width="100" height="5"></p>

<blockquote>
        <p>Tymeac may quiesce and terminate gracefully.</p>
        <p>Tymeac supports <a href="UserExits.html">user exits</a> for shut down.</p>
  <p>Tymeac shuts down in two (and possibly three) stages. Tymeac is a thread
  manager.&nbsp;When there are no Queue Threads active, then stage two immediately follows
  stage one without further user action and the Server terminates quickly.</p>
    <p>Quiesce means to quiet or calm. Shut down quiets by rejecting new requests and letting
    those already in progress complete. When there is no more activity, the Server stops
    gracefully.</p>
    <p>There are three exceptions to in progress completion:<ol>
      <li><p align="left">One is scheduling. Since shut down means stop, those requests in the
        middle of being scheduled cannot complete. The logic here is that the Server may be under
        stress and the shut down request is meant to quickly terminate the Server. Waiting for
        each Queue to schedule may hold up the termination indefinitely.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left">The second is recursive requests. Since the Server 
      cannot know from where the request originates, a recursive request is 
      simply a new request and it rejects.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left">The third is forcing termination. We get into this when discussing stage
        2.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  <p align="left">There are two implementation methods for shut down:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p align="left"><strong>public String shutRequest()</strong>; -- This is the same as the second with a boolean false.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><strong><a name="kill"></a>public String shutRequest(boolean kill)</strong>; -- This
      version supports compelling termination in the case when there are unresponsive Queue
      Threads.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">For all normal shut down requests, you should set the boolean to false or
    simply use version 1. If normal shutdown cannot progress and you need the Server down
    quickly, then set the boolean to true.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Killing the server still executes the shut down exits, statistics 
    and <a href="#shuthread">shut down thread </a>(when chosen.) Killing only 
    ignores the presents of active Queue Threads. If not using the shut down 
    thread and a user exit Class is hanging, then killing has no effect.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>The first stage:</strong>&nbsp; [the first <b>shutRequest()</b> 
  received by the server]<ul>
    <li>Blocks the acceptance of further requests into the system.&nbsp;Tymeac rejects any
      further requests into the system and returns a <a href="Usage.html#broker">request
      brokering error</a> or a <a href="Usage.html#schd">scheduling error </a>to the caller.</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="Images/Caution.gif" alt="Caution.gif (1012 bytes)" width="20" height="20">&nbsp; Multiple Queue
    requests currently in scheduling reject.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>For example, a request with three Queues enters the system.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Queue 1 schedules.<br>
        The shut down request enters.<br>
        Queue 2 fails scheduling because of shut down.<br>
        No further scheduling takes place, the request rejects.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><img src="Images/Caution.gif" alt="Caution.gif (1012 bytes)" width="20" height="20">&nbsp; Nested processing
    requests fail.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>For example, a request uses a Queue with a Processing Application Class that
      recursively calls the Tymeac Server for a new request. (The&nbsp;<a href="ex1.html#complex">example section</a>, portfolio revaluation, describes
      this.)&nbsp;When that Processing Application Class calls the Tymeac Server for the new
      request, the new request rejects.</p>

    <li><p align="left">For non-Output Agent Queues:</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">When there are Synchronous requests working, shut down informs the live
    Queue Threads to terminate upon completion of all work in the Wait Lists.</p>
    <p align="left">When no Synchronous requests are working, shut down terminates the Queue

  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p>When there are Asynchronous requests working, the Output Agent Queue Threads remain
    waiting for new work since they may schedule at any time.&nbsp;(Asynchronous requests may
    schedule an Output Agent Queue. Therefore, the Output Agent Queue Threads must remain
    active until all work finishes.)</p>
    <p>When no Asynchronous requests are working, shut down terminates the Output Agent Queue
    Threads.</p>
  </blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The second stage</strong>:&nbsp; [second <b>shutRequest() </b>
  received by the server or when no Queue Threads are active.]</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="Images/Caution.gif" alt="Caution.gif (1012 bytes)" width="20" height="20">&nbsp; 
  Stage 2 (and Stage 3 naturally) cannot begin until Stage 1 is complete.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Stage 1 may use Stage 1 user exits. If one thread is executing a 
  Stage 1 <a href="UserExits.html">user exit Class</a> and a second thread 
  starts a Stage 2 user exit Class the result could be disastrous. Since the 
  shut down user exit Classes run as part of the main Tymeac structure (not as a 
  separate thread), a stall in one of these Classes stalls the entire shut down 
  sequence.</p>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><p align="left">When there are Synchronous requests working, forces termination of all
      live, non-Output Agent Queue Threads. The Queue Threads terminate without finishing
      requests in the Wait Lists. This means that Synchronous request in progress time-out while

    </li>
    <li><p align="left">For Output Agent Queues:</p>
    </li>
    <p>When there were asynchronous requests working at the time of prior shut down, then this
    stage informs the live Output Agent Queue Threads to terminate upon completion of all work
    in the Wait Lists. (Just like the stage 1 shutdown for non-Output Agent Queue Threads.) In
    order to force termination, one must request shut down again. (See the <a href="Shutdown.html#shutex">example</a>, below.)</p>
    <p><strong>The third or Force stage</strong>&nbsp; [subsequent <b>shutRequest()
    </b>received by the server]
    (when requests were working in stage two and threads were active.)]</ul>

    <p>There is no way to terminate a Java thread that is not responding.&nbsp;Three options
    are available for unresponsive Queue Threads:<ol>
      <li><p align="left">Use the Tymeac Queue Thread Class (<a href="TyQueThd.html">TyQueThd</a>)
        to logically disable the thread.&nbsp;This does not kill the thread but marks the entry as
        &quot;disabled&quot;. This permits the completion of shut down.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left">Use a Java/operating system tool to kill the thread. Then use step one,
        above, to logically disable the entry.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Use the shut down &quot;kill&quot; option. This is a shut request with a boolean true.
        E.G.<br>
        shutRequest(true);</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If the Server hangs due to a faulty exit class, then your only alternative is to
    manually kill the Server.</p>

  <p><strong><a name="NB"></a>N.B.</strong>&nbsp; <b>When using the Activation 
  Framework:</b>&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Inactivation (after the inactivation time elapses (<a href="TyCfg.html#activate">DBMS 
  mode</a>, <a href="UserVariables.html">Stand-A-Lone mode</a>) is performed by 
  the Monitor. Part of the inactivation procedure is to shut down the Server 
  before inactivating the process from the Activation Run Time. </p>
  <p>As long as no requests for shut down are outstanding, then the Monitor runs 
  through stage 1 and 2 as above, then inactivates:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; java.rmi.activation.Activatable.inactive()</p>
    <blockquote>
  <p>and issues a System.exit().</p>
    </blockquote>
  <p>If a prior request for shut down is outstanding, then the Monitor waits 
  respectfully for the shut down to complete. After a wait period, the Monitor 
  completes the shut down when possible and un-registers the Server from the 
  Activation System.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; java.rmi.activation.Activatable.unregister()</p>
    <blockquote>
  <p>and issues a System.exit().</p>
    </blockquote>
  <p>Therefore, you must re-register the Tymeac Server to use it again.</p>
  <p>As noted above, any procedure that stalls, will hang the shut down. When 
  the Monitor believes a stalled shut down is preventing the process from 
  ending, the Monitor logs and prints messages. The <a href="TyNotify.html">
  Notification System</a> is no long alive since shut down prevents new requests 
  from starting. A shutting down but stalled Server is of no use to anyone and 
  it remains an active process in the computer system.</p>
