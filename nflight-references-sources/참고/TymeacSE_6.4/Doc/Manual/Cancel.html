<h1>Canceling a Request</h1>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>It may be necessary at times to cancel an active (a)synchronous request. While you can
      cancel the request, you cannot stop the active processing. That is, you cannot force a
      thread to stop. For an explanation on why, see the Java API documentation on the Thread.stop() method.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are three basic Tymeac Server Methods available for Clients:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>shutRequest()&nbsp; --- Shut down the Tymeac Server.</li>
      <li>asyncRequest() -- Request_without_waiting for completion.</li>
      <li>syncRequest() --- Request_with_wait for completion</li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>shutRequest()</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Once a shut down sequence begins, there is no way to reverse it.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><a name="async"></a><strong>asyncRequest()</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The asynchronous request has three stages of processing:<ol>
      <li>In Output Agent stage (after processing all the normal queues.)</li>
      <li>Actively processing in normal queues.</li>
      <li>Not started</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When in the Output Agent stage,</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>you must use the <a href="TyStalled.html">Stalled Request Display/Alter</a> to effect
      any changes.</p>
      <p>This assumes the request exceeded the allowable time limit and is marked
      &quot;stalled.&quot; If the Output Agent Processing Application Class hasn't exceed the
      time limit, then you must wait until it does. This is a case of trying to stop a thread.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>When actively processing or not started,</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>you may use the <a href="TyReqStatus.html">Request Status/Cancel Display</a> (or the
      non-GUI class) to cancel the request.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>If you catch the request before any processing begins, then you may completely remove
      the request as if it had never been received.</p>
      <p>If the request is actively processing, </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>then the request is removed from each Queue's Wait List when possible.</p>
        <p>The Queue Threads ignore any output from the Processing Application Class and when at
        the last application process in the Tymeac Function, the Queue Thread ignores starting the
        Output Agent process.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><a name="sync"></a><strong>syncRequest() (and use of the <a href="#cancel">cancelSyncReq() method</a>)</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This is very difficult for those not intimate with multi-threading. The 
    good part is even though you may have no idea what is happening after 
    reading what follows, the examples we 
    supply work and you may simply clone those for your own use. (We have a 
    GUI demo too.)</p>
    <p><b>In a Synchronous Request, </b> <br>
    the Tymeac Server (Endpoint) Connection Thread is waiting for the Queue 
    Threads to finish before issuing a return to the calling Client. </p>
    <p>Since both the Tymeac Server (Endpoint) Connection Thread and the Client 
    calling thread are 
    both in a wait state, we need more threads.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Specifically: you issue a call to the Tymeac Server with a synchronous 
    request in a thread: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Object[] back = server.syncRequest()<br>
    Your client calling thread is now waiting for a response.</p>
    <p>On the Server side, </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>when using RMI, the RMI runtime creates an end-point connection thread<br>
    when using the internal server, your client thread is the end-point.</p>
    <p><img border="0" src="Images/Remote.jpg" width="225" height="228">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <img border="0" src="Images/Embedded.jpg" width="225" height="228"></p>
    <p>Tymeac schedules your request to one or more Queues (depending on your 
    requirements.) A Queue Thread, from the thread pool on each 
    Queue, picks up your request and processes it. The end-point thread then waits for 
    the Queue Thread[s] to finish.</p>
    <p>What &quot;cancel&quot; has to do is have a <u>new</u> client thread communicate with the 
    server end-point thread that is 
    waiting for the Queue Thread[s] to finish and tell it to 'wake up and forget about 
    those other guys.' (the other guys being the Queue Threads)</p>
    <p>Simple.</p>
    </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>There are two methods for canceling a synchronous request -- a cancel word and call
    back. There are two methods because each has drawbacks.</p>
    <p>These methods are not mutually exclusive. You may use both in any syncRequest(). You may
    execute both at different times and even execute each multiple times (the Server rejects
    subsequent requests with an invalid request_id.) There is no TymeacParm constructor using
    both. There are TymeacParm setters for each.</p>
    <p><strong>Cancel Word</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>A cancel word is a unique number (long integer) the Client wishes to 
      associate with a synchronous request. This number must be truly unique for 
      all active<sup><a href="#one" style="text-decoration: none">1</a></sup> requests in the
      Tymeac Server. You place the cancel word in the <a href="TymeacParm.html#callback">TymeacParm</a>.</p>
      <p>When you do a syncRequest(), the Server checks the cancel word against all current synchronous requests 
      that use a cancel word and rejects the request if it finds
      a duplicate. The development of a unique number is only limited by imagination. For the
      demonstration classes, we use a random number, method nextLong() in java.util.Random.</p>
      <p>You will need one class (<strong>com.tymeac.base.CancelParm</strong>) in addition to
      your normal Tymeac Client/Server classes.</p>

    <p>The classes are already compiled including a stub for the remote method. You can run a
    test in the same way you start any Tymeac Client. If the original call to Tymeac returns
    before you can issue a cancel, then you must either slow down the processing or increase
    the load on the server.</p>
    <p>You can slow down the processing in an application by putting in a delay of several
    seconds. This is a method we use. (It is the method to use for the Internal Server.) In
    one of the Demo classes (Demo1 for Queue AAAA) before it does anything, issue a Try {
    Thread.sleep(5000) and catch InterruptedException. The sleep is for milliseconds so the
    number of seconds you want it to sleep is multiplied by 1000.</p>
    <p>To increase the load on the [remote] Server, DO NOT PUT IN A SLEEP AS ABOVE. Use the <a href="TyDemoT3.html">com.tymeac.demo.TyDemoT3</a> class and start many threads, but note
    below.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> as mentioned above, each <u>cal</u>l <u>back</u> cancel request
    requires a remote object exported on a port. If you run into &quot;port&quot; problems,
    then the request containing the callback parm may hang until the system clears.
    (Communication parameters are unique for each installation. Solutions naturally depend on
    your environment.)</p>

  <p>The single parameter is the <a href="../JavaDoc/com/tymeac/base/CancelParm.html"><strong>CancelParm</strong></a>
  class.</p>
  <p>When using a <strong>Cancel Word</strong>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Client constructs the CancelParm object using the single arg constructor:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CancelParm cp = new CancelParm(cancel_word);</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When using a <strong>Call Back</strong>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Tymeac Server constructs the CancelParm object using the two arg constructor:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new CancelParm(<em>session_id</em>, <em>request_id</em>)</p>
    <p>The Tymeac Server passes the CancelParm class to the Client when it finds an
    InterruptionReady instance in the <em>callback</em> field of the TymeacParm class. The
    TymeacParm class is the parameter a Client passed to the Tymeac Server on a syncRequest(). The
    Tymeac Server uses a callback function (remote or internal) by executing the ready()
    method of the InterruptionReady interface.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>callback</em>.ready(new CancelParm(<em>session_id</em>, <em>request_id</em>)); </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Tymeac Server executes the ready() method in a new, internal asynchronous request.
    Therefore, if this method throws any Exception, then the Client will never get the
    callback. The Server logs all exceptions.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Client executes the cancelSyncReq() method using RMI for remote communication or as
  a local call for the internal server.</p>
