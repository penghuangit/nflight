<h1>How a Thread Becomes Disabled. </h1>

        <p>This section details the reasons a Tymeac Thread becomes logically disabled.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The status of <a href="Definitions.html#quethread">Queue Threads</a> (Threads for this
  discussion) is relevant to scheduling.</p>
  <p>Threads process a request and then look in the Wait Lists for the next request.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>When the status of any Thread is 'busy', it is reasonable to assume that since a thread
    is actively processing, this Thread or another Thread will process any request put into a
    Wait List.&nbsp;It is also reasonable to assume that Threads with a status of 'notified'
    or 'reactivated' will become active shortly and process the Wait Lists.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When a Thread remains in an active or about to be active state for an unreasonable
  amount of time then something may be wrong. In such a case, marking the thread 'cancelled'
  and then 'disabled' after even more elapsed time is a way of eliminating the Thread from
  consideration during scheduling.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>For a non performing Queue, rather than filling up all the Wait Lists with pending
    requests and returning a &quot;no Wait List available&quot; message to the new request,
    Tymeac rejects the request immediately with a &quot;no thread available&quot; message. The
    &quot;no Wait List available&quot; message could mean, try again later. The &quot;no
    thread available&quot; message means something is wrong.&nbsp; See also <a href="SchdFail.html">scheduling failures</a>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Monitor Thread notifies system administrators when all Threads are 'disabled'.</p>
  <p><strong>An entry becomes 'disabled' by:</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>1. An unhandled or re-thrown exception in a <a href="Definitions.html#pap">Processing
  Application Class</a>.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Threads handle exceptions by marking the Thread 'disabled'.</p>
  <p>2. When a user manually disables a thread in the <a href="TyQueThd.html">Queue Thread
  display/alter</a>.</p>
  <p>3. When the Thread detects Immediate <a href="Shutdown.html">Shut Down</a>.</p>
  <p>4. The <a href="Monitor.html">Monitor Thread</a> changes the status from Cancelled to
  Disabled.</p>

        <p>When that value is greater than zero, then the Queue's timeout value is used.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp; The time the Thread calls the Scheduler (for the Output Agent
      Queue).</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The maximum time allowable is 1<strong style="font-weight: 400"><i>(bi)<br>

        base interval</i></strong>.)</p>

      <p><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp; The time the Scheduler 'notifies' a waiting Queue Thread.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The maximum time allowable is 2<strong style="font-weight: 400"><i>(bi)<br>
&nbsp; (</i></strong>two times
        <strong style="font-weight: 400"><i>the base interval</i></strong>.)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>For 1-5 [ <a href="#foot1">Is all this necessary?</a></strong>&nbsp;<b>]</b><br>
      When the Thread exceeds the time, the Monitor sets the
      entry 'cancelled'.&nbsp;The next time the Monitor runs, it sets all 'cancelled'
      entries 'disabled'.&nbsp;If a Thread resumes processing, the Thread resets the entry,
      irrespective of any prior setting.&nbsp;Each time the Thread changes status it resets the
      time. Therefore, this is not a cumulative total nor overall elapsed time.</p>
      <p>As stated above, disabled Threads cannot participate in scheduling. 
      However, users may enable those disabled Threads with the
      <a href="TyQueThd.html">Queue Threads</a> GUI/non-GUI. Now it gets 
      interesting.</p>
      <p>&quot;Enabling all threads&quot; nulls the instance reference to the actual Thread 
      in the Thread-Management Class (AreaThreadMgmt) and sets the status 
      of the Thread in the same class to &quot;available for a new thread&quot;. If the old 
      Thread awakens, it both checks to see if it's instance reference is null 
      or if another thread has taken its place and dies gracefully. For a more detailed discussion of 
      expunged threads, see the
      <a href="InternalStructure.html#areaDetail">AreaThreadMgmt</a> Class and 
      the footnote.</p>

<hr>

<p><b><a name="foot1"></a>Is all this timing necessary?</b></p>
<blockquote>

<p>In order to know if all this timing is necessary we must first answer the  
question, &quot;Can a thread stall or die during processing?&quot;  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>The answer is yes. 
Hardware, operating systems, the implementation of the JVM, Tymeac code and user 
code can all fail at anytime. Tymeac is a professional product; professionals 
plan for anomalies. Now, on to the timing question.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It should be obvious that when Tymeac invokes your Processing Application 
Class, the execution may block or take an excessive amount of time. It may even 
stall completely. Therefore, timing this event is a no-brainer. That takes care 
of number 3.</p>

<p>Numbers 5 and sometimes 1 have to do with Thread state changes. That is, 
going from a waiting or timed waiting state to a running state. (See 
java.lang.Thread state codes.) It is unlikely that there would be a significant 
delay in the thread getting CPU time after this state change, but it could 
happen.</p>

<p>Numbers 4 and sometimes 1 have to do with creating a new thread either for 
the Normal or Output Agent Queue. Since creating a new thread usually involves 
communicating with the underlying operating system, there could be a delay. It 
is unlikely that there would be a significant delay, but it could happen.</p>

<p>Number 2 is Tymeac code. As much as 
we like to think it is unlikely that there could be a bug, it could happen.</p>

<p>Finally there is just plain something going wrong somewhere. Like the &quot;<em>spurious 
wakeup</em>&quot; that may happen to a waiting thread, a running thread may also die 
or stall or another thread may damage the current thread's control structure at 
the operating system level. It could happen.</p>

<p>The consistent phrase here is &quot;it could happen.&quot; What we really mean is it 
could happen again. Having done multi-tasking/threading for many decades we've run 
into these problems before and we expect to see them again.</p>

<p>Therefore, all this timing is necessary. But what about all the overhead?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There isn't much overhead associated with 
this timing.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each time a Queue Thread changes status it checks whether it&nbsp; 
has been expunged. If not, it sets the current time (System.currentTimeMillis()) 
  into the field associated with this current status and nulls the time fields 
  associated with other status codes. This is very little work and no object 
  creation.</li>
  <li>For a heavily used system the status changes are from Tymeac code to the 
  Application code and back to Tymeac code. This is: fetching a request from the 
  wait list, the application process, saving the application's object and 
  fetching the next request. Exactly where timing is most necessary (the 
  no-brainer above.)</li>
  <li>When the Tymeac Monitor runs (probably about once a minute) it checks only 
  one timing event: the current status of the Queue Thread. This is very little 
  work and also no object creation.</li>
</ul>

<p>For all the benefits of timing, the overhead is piddle.</p>
