<h1>Thread Management</h1>

    <blockquote>

<p>Article: <a href="../Articles/J2SEArticle.html">Managing Threads in Java SE</a></p>

<p>There are two major issues with Java Threads:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Concurrency</li>
        <li>Control</li>
      </ol>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Just as there are two similar issues with juggling balls.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p align="left">When the balls are in the air, the balls may try to occupy the same space at the same time. A 
  concurrency issue.</li>
  <li>
  <p align="left">When launching and catching the balls one needs to tightly 
  coordinate the throw/catch so that a hand is free when a ball needs catching. A control issue.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Failure to address both these issues means the endeavor will fail sooner or 
later.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>

<h3>Concurrency</h3>
  <blockquote>

<p>The good folks at the JSR166 expert group are doing a superb job of&nbsp;dealing with this issue. The current java.util.concurrent package and the soon 
to be released fork-join package represent many years of effort in development. 
Hats off to these people.</p>
  </blockquote>

<h3><a name="control"></a>Control</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Java threads are most difficult to control. What if a thread gets stuck in a blocking method? What if something is 
    wrong and the thread doesn't get CPU time? What if there is a bug? There are 
    lots of 'what if'' situations. See for example
    <a href="../Brochure/Shadow.htm">the Shadow.</a></p>
    <p>Tymeac is a superb implementation of a very simple concept:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <h4><font color="#000080">Put requests in queues for processing by 
      asynchronous threads.</font></h4>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Tymeac comprises queues with each queue having its own 
    pool of threads. However, Tymeac Queue Threads are not your traditional pool 
    threads. Every Queue Thread has its own
    <a href="InternalStructure.html#areaDetail">management structure</a>. Each 
    event in the life of a Queue Thread <a href="Disabled.html#five">is timed</a>. 
    Although there is no way to stop a thread, Tymeac handles the run-a-way or 
    blocking-forever thread problems as best as can be handled at the 
    application level.</p>
    <p><b>Interrupt</b><br>
    Thread &quot;interrupt()&quot; is a disaster. The original developers probably had 
    a vision that programmers would want to interrupt an executing thread. But 
    they never perfected that vision. What we have now are threads interrupting 
    themselves as well as other threads sometimes with erroneous results.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Lets say you create thread “A” and you expect that thread to complete 
      some work within a time limit. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You execute a timed wait for thread “A”. </li>
        <li>Thread “A” does not complete within the time limit, 
        <ul>
          <li>the time expires and </li>
          <li>you regain control. </li>
          <li>Your code continues with other work.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Then you have a second timed wait for another thread “B”. </li>
        <li>If thread “A” then issues interrupt(), it interrupts the caller at 
        the second wait.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This can easily happen with packages you acquire and cannot alter, 
      especially message-writer methods. It is common practice to make a 
      message-writer a separate thread so it doesn’t affect the main thread if 
      it hangs or causes an exception.</p>
      <p>If you have a multi-thread environment (i.e. thread “C”, “D” etc.), 
      then using interrupt() only exacerbates the problem.</p>
      <p>interrupt() is like getting kicked in the butt – you know you’ve been 
      kicked but you don’t know who did it, when or why.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Tymeac does not use &quot;interrupt()&quot;. All communication with Queue Threads 
    is done through the thread's management structure.</p>
    <p><b>NotifyAll</b><br>
    Both
    NotifyAll() and SignalAll() are shot gun methods. Having multiple threads 
    waiting on a single object is a course grained solution. When the group 
    awakens every thread must do some work to find out if it is needed. Even if 
    each thread is running on a separate CPU it still requires operating system 
    CPU cycles to get the threads running and put the unnecessary threads back 
    into a blocking state.</p>
    <p>Tymeac notifies each thread individually – only when it is needed. By 
    having a management structure for each Queue Thread, Tymeac knows the exact 
    status of each Queue Thread so there are no wasted cycles notifying 
    unnecessary threads.</p>
    <p><b>Thread Pool</b><br>
    <a href="Tuning.html#pool">Tymeac's approach to the thread pool</a> is to 
    have only the minimum number of threads running at any given time so that 
    Tymeac <a href="Tuning.html#nice">plays nice</a> with other applications.</p>
    <p><b>Tuning</b><br>
    <a href="Tuning.html">Tymeac is tunable</a>. Trying to manage traditional 
    pool threads is 
    like trying to herd cats.</p>
    <p><b>Monitoring</b><br>
    Since Java threads execute at the application level there is no high level 
    manager to supervise the environment. Tymeac uses a
    <a href="Monitor.html">Monitor</a> (daemon) at the application level that 
    periodically scans the environment looking for problems.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b>Exceptions</b><br>
    When thread exceptions occur, Tymeac doesn't just let the system print an ugly 
message and kill the thread. Tymeac catches exceptions (including with an uncaught exception 
    handler), prints and
<a href="RunTime.html#log">logs</a> meaningful messages with
<a href="Messages.html">full documentation</a>, and <a href="RunTime.html#notify">
notifies</a> administrators of the problem.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Since most errors are with the user-written Classes (<a href="Develop.html#pap">Developing Your Applications</a> 
    discusses this in detail), Tymeac allows 
    dynamic repair and reload of those Classes with/without a <a href="TyNewCopy.html">
    GUI </a>and restarting of the disabled threads with/without a
    <a href="TyQueThd.html">GUI</a>.</p>
    </blockquote>
