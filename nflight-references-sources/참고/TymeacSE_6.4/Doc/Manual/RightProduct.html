<h1>Is This The Right Product For You?</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This is the standard edition (Java SE version 1.6+) component oriented Fork/Join 
  product.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Tymeac separates your request into it's individual components. </li>
      <li>Tymeac places each component onto a Queue, serviced by a thread 
      pool. </li>
      <li>A thread in each thread pool executes the component and returns a 
      result to the server.</li>
      <li>Tymeac joins the individual components together and returns it to the 
      caller.</li>
      <li>Tymeac supports both synchronous and asynchronous 
      requests. </li>
      <li>Additionally, Tymeac also supports agents for asynchronous requests. </li>
      <li>Using Tymeac is like programming completely separate components all 
      running simultaneously. </li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If you need a standard edition that runs on the Java Micro Edition, 
  then download TymeacME.</p>
  <hr noshade color="#000000" width="20%">
  <p>Also available for download is the Divide-and Conquer product (TymeacDSE); also known as scatter-gather.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>TymeacDSE allows you to break up your request into small, identical tasks according 
      to your thresholds</li>
      <li>TymeacDSE scatters the tasks to every thread in the system</li>
      <li>Your code implements two abstract methods in class, Task: compute() 
      and complete()</li>
      <li>Your code executing inside the compute() method either creates more 
      tasks or returns an object</li>
      <li>When all the  tasks finish processing, TymeacDSE calls the complete() 
      method passing the list of objects from the compute() methods.&nbsp; </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Divide-and-Conquer is best known in the compute intensive, 
    scientific/academic arena. That is, when each task does a small, compute 
    intensive function such as summing an array of numbers.</p>
    <p>Divide-and-Conquer does very well with sorting and map/reduce. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Phase one is to split the large array into many smaller arrays for 
      sorting or mapping. When the split array is small enough, it is processed 
      in the sub-task.</p>
      <p>Phase two is to merge or reduce the sorted lists.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Divide-and-Conquer is the sweetheart of massive data processing on 
    massive multi-core processors where each task does identical work. If you 
    can run this product on 16, 32, 64 CPU machines then you are going to love 
    TymeacDSE.</p>
    <p>Divide-and-Conquer doesn't do very well on small numbers of processors or 
    small amounts of data. On a dual-core processor, it takes more time to break up 
    the request then it does to simply process the array sequentially. If you 
    only have a small array, why bother with additional work?</p>
    <p>Divide-and-Conquer doesn't do very well when each element in an array 
    needs different processing or needs to access outside resources. There are 
    no restrictions on accessing outside resources or inter-task communication. 
    It's just the waiting and resource coordination can take a lot of time </p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>If you need a standard edition that runs on the Android platform (API 
    Level 8 and above), then download TymeacAND.</p>
