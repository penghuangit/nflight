<h1>Multi-Server Load Balancing</h1>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>We often get requests for our opinion on load balancing multiple Tymeac RMI Servers in
        a network. We try to avoid application design issues.&nbsp;We provide a development tool
        -- an asynchronous-process manager.&nbsp;How one uses this tool is beyond our scope.
        However, customers have common thoughts on this subject and it is these that we share with
        you here.</p>
      </blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <h3><strong>Background:</strong></h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Since Tymeac is an RMI Server, it is a component in the network.&nbsp;The network may
    be a local host or that which transcends multiple machines.&nbsp;Naturally, when dealing
    with a local host, transport time issues are negligible.</p>
    <p>The problem involves how to distribute work among several Tymeac Servers in a network.
    The work is a procedure, that, for various considerations, needs splitting onto several
    servers.&nbsp;This may be for memory usage, I/O, security, the number of concurrent
    requests for this service or any other consideration.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3 style="text-align: justify">Assumptions:</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>There are many Tymeac Servers that support the procedure.</li>
      <li>Each Tymeac Server does not know about the other Tymeac Servers that support the
        procedure. That is, each Server is an independent entity.</li>
    </ol>
    <p style="text-align: justify">This second assumption requires some explaining.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In order for each Tymeac Server to know about all other Tymeac Servers would require a
      huge amount of overhead <u>in each Server</u> to keep track of who is where doing what.</p>
      <p>While this is not a problem when there are two or three Servers in the local machine,
      consider the overhead when there are two or three dozen Servers across many machines in a
      network. Each Server must contact all other servers when every request starts when every
      request ends and every time there is any kind of problem.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Therefore, to support this second assumption we need a process in-between the Client
    and the network of Tymeac Servers (the router).</p>
    <p>The contrary argument to the router is that of the middleman problem. As often happens,
    the question inevitably arises, &quot;Why is this middleman necessary?&quot;&nbsp;The bold
    heading <strong>issues:</strong>, below, point out the problems with a middleman approach.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3 style="text-align: justify">Router:</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="text-align: justify">The router knows about all active Tymeac Servers that
    support the procedure. It contains a list of the String(name) and the reference to the
    Remote Object (Interface TymeacInterface).</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">As each Tymeac Server that supports the procedure
    initializes, a User Function (see <a href="StartUpFunctions.html">Start Up Functions</a>)
    passes the name of the Tymeac Server along with the reference to the RemoteObject to the
    router.&nbsp;As each Tymeac Server that supports the procedure shuts down, a User Exit
    (see <a href="UserExits.html">User Exits</a>) passes the name of the Tymeac Server to the
    router.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">The router may use the <a href="TyOverall.html#over">TyOverStatus</a>
    Tymeac Function to inquire of the load on each of these Servers.</p>
    <p>The router contains the logic to determine which Tymeac Server should process the
    request from a client. There are three basic scenarios:<ol>
      <li>The client contacts the router and the router returns the reference to the RemoteObject
        for the Tymeac Server (pass back).</li>
      <li>The client contacts the router and the router passes the request to the Tymeac Server
        (pass through).</li>
      <li>A combination of both (hybrid.)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Each client obtains the reference to the RemoteObject for the router from a <a href="#registry">Registry</a> or <a href="#private">private</a>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <h3 style="text-align: justify">Pass Back:</h3>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Each client contacts the router <u>for every request</u>. The router returns the
      reference to the RemoteObject of the Tymeac Server best able to handle the request.</p>
      <p>Each client does a single Tymeac request (asyncRequest(), syncRequest()).</p>
      <h4 style="text-align: justify">Issues:</h4>
      <blockquote>
        <p>This resembles the Internet where every &quot;www&quot; request must go to a common
        service that passes back the IP address.</p>
        <p>Clients may only use the Tymeac Server RemoteObject one time since it may not be best
        able to handle the next request.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <h3 style="text-align: justify">Pass Through:</h3>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The object the clients pass to the Tymeac Server must go through the router.&nbsp;This
      involves de-serializing&nbsp; the object in the router and re-serializing the object in
      the router to pass on to the Tymeac Server.</p>
      <p>The object the Tymeac Server returns to the client must go through the
      router.&nbsp;This involves de-serializing&nbsp; the object in the router and
      re-serializing the object in the router to return to the client.</p>
      <h4 style="text-align: justify">Issues:</h4>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Using a MarshalledObject significantly reduces the serialization parameter.</p>
        <p>Using a call back scheme eliminates the return message problem:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The client (having exported its RemoteObject) passes its RemoteObject to the
          router.&nbsp;The router de-serializes the passed object, extracts the object for pass
          through and re-serializes that object that is to pass on to the Tymeac Server.</p>
          <p>The router may or may not respond to the client.</p>
          <p>The router uses a Tymeac asyncRequest() and may ignore the response therefrom.</p>
          <p>Your Processing Application uses the client's RemoteObject to respond to the request.</p>
