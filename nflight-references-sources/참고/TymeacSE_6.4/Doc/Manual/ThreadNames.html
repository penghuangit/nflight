<h1>Tymeac Thread Names</h1>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Tymeac uses Java threads.&nbsp;The following is a discussion of the names of those
        threads, their purpose, and how to eliminate them.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tymeac Queue Threads:</strong>&nbsp; The name of this thread is 
  determined as below.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>These are the individual threads that
  processes your requests.&nbsp;The number for each Queue is set in Queue Maintenance, <a href="TyQueMaint.html">TyQueMaint</a>.&nbsp;Each thread is named &quot;TyQ-&quot; plus the
  Queue Name, or partial name, and a sequence number starting at zero, see TyQueMaint. There
  is no naming difference between normal and Output Agent threads. The Display of the status
  of these threads is in <a href="TyQueThd.html">TyQueThd</a>. Killing a thread is done with
  a Java tool. However, TyQueThd discusses side effects.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tymeac Monitor:</strong>&nbsp; The name of this thread is <u>TymeacMonitor</u>.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>The use of asynchronous threads requires a <a href="Monitor.html">monitor</a>.&nbsp;For
  testing environments this thread may be eliminated by specifying a Monitor Interval of
  zero, or killing the thread with a Java tool..</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tymeac Logging:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The name of the thread is <u>TymeacLogger</u>. </p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Message <a href="RunTime.html#log">logging</a> is optional. One may use a 
  DBMS Table or a local file. However, the actual write blocks until complete 
  and may therefore cause a delay in Tymeac processing or a hard stall. 
  Therefore, to avoid problems, all &quot;writing&quot; is through this thread.&nbsp;Tymeac creates/destroys this thread at
  start up to verify the Table or file. Tymeac creates/destroys this thread to write a
  message.&nbsp;Therefore, if this thread &quot;hangs&quot;, killing this thread has no
  affect on the normal functioning of Tymeac.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tymeac Statistics:</strong>&nbsp; The name of the thread is <u>TymeacStatsWriter</u>.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p> <a href="RunTime.html#stats">Statistics</a>
  are optional.&nbsp;One may use a DBMS Table or a local file. However, the actual write
  blocks until complete and may therefore cause a delay in Tymeac processing or a hard
  stall. Therefore, to avoid problems, all &quot;writing&quot; is through this thread. The
  name of the thread is <u>TymeacStatsWriter</u>. Tymeac creates/destroys this thread at
  start up to verify the Table or file. Tymeac creates/destroys this thread to write the
  statistics. Therefore, if this thread &quot;hangs&quot;, killing this thread has no affect
  on the normal functioning of Tymeac.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>The problems this thread avoids are: If the writing should stall, this is not serious
    in the case of an on-request request where the GUI user may simply kill the request.
    However, during shut down Tymeac may hang requiring manual intervention.&nbsp;The killer
    is during de-activation.&nbsp;This is when the Activation System de-activates Tymeac. In
    such a case, there may be no person available to intervene.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Tymeac waits up to 45 seconds for the statistics to finish writing.&nbsp;If the time
    expires, Tymeac ignores further statistics writing.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tymeac Shutdown:&nbsp; </strong>The name of this thread is <u>TymeacShutDown</u>. </p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>This is an optional thread.&nbsp;You select
  this option in the Tymeac Configuration File, <a href="TyCfg.html">TyCfg</a>, or User
  Variables, <a href="UserVariables.html">TyUserVariables</a>.&nbsp;(RMI Servers are keep
  alive by a thread that never ends and each Tymeac Server waits forever ( wait() ) so that
  necessary variables do not garbage collect.)&nbsp;The Tymeac Shutdown thread starts at the
  final stage of Tymeac <a href="Shutdown.html">shut down</a>. This thread calls 
  System.exit(0), which ends the Java Virtual Machine. You may kill this thread 
  without side effects.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tymeac Post Start Up Processing:&nbsp; </strong>The name of this 
  thread is <u>TymeacPostProc</u>.<blockquote>
  <p>Tymeac <a href="StartUp.html">Start
  Up</a> starts this thread after rebinding (non-activation) or after the basic start up
  (activation).&nbsp;This is temporary thread that: <ol>
    <li>Verifies the that the user <a href="TyNotify.html">Notification</a> Function is alive
      and well. You select this option (Notify Function) in the Tymeac Configuration File, <a href="TyCfg.html">TyCfg</a>, or <a href="UserVariables.html">User Variables</a>. The
      thread calls the Tymeac Server for a syncRequest() and waits for a response. It then
      prints an appropriate message.</li>
    <li>Executes the <a href="StartUpFunctions.html">start up Functions</a>, if present.</li>
    <li>The thread terminates. If this thread remains, then something is wrong with RMI 
    communication (check for other messages) with the Notification Function, or 
    with the start up Functions.</li>
  </ol>
