<h1>Release Notes</h1>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Release 6.4 June 2013</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Added the <a href="TymeacReturn.html">TymeacReturn</a> class for standard 
    checking of the returned Object[] from sync and async calls. Updated all the 
    demonstration classes to use this new class where applicable.</p>
    <p>Various documentation enhancements.</p>
    <p>Still no Java7 only code to keep the Java6 crew happy.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Release 6.3.3 April 2013</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Added an Enabled Specific button to the Queue Threads Display/Alter.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Minor modifications to base Classes to support the above.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Various documentation enhancements.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Release 6.3.2 March 2013</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Moved timing values out of several classes into the TyBase Class for 
    consistency.</p>
    <p>Various documentation enhancements.</p>
    <p>Still no Java7 only code to keep the Java6 crew happy.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Release 6.3.1 September 2012</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Minor restructuring of Queue initialization and start up procedure.</p>
    <p>Cosmetic clean up of compiler warning&nbsp; messages.</p>
    <p>That's all folks. It's running very well.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Release 6.3 September 2011</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Added the Alter Server Options GUI. This gives users the ability to alter 
    the shut down option, monitor interval and inactivation minutes at runtime.</p>
    <p>You must reinstall the complete package since the TymeacInterface class 
    changed. This also means re-compiling those classes that depend on that 
    interface (the serial version id will be different.)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Release 6.2.2 June 2010</h2>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Yes, it's been awhile.</p>
  <p>Two minor bugs fixed:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The Wait List display and statistics Wait List detail were erroneous 
      in that they skipped every other row.<br>
      The iterator was updated twice instead of once.</li>
      <li>The Post Processor thread (runs just after Tymeac initial start up) 
      that verifies the Notification Function and <br>
      executes the start up Functions very rarely got ahead of the finalization 
      method in the main start up thread.<br>
      The classic example of what thread gets execution time at any given 
      instant. A slight delay in the Post<br>
      Processor thread, when necessary, fixed that.</li>
    </ol>
  <p>Added server up-time duration on shutdown message and statistics.</p>
  <p>This release makes the variables, &quot;final&quot;, in the base package that can be 
  set so. There is a performance gain in <br>
  using: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private final int max_threads; over<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private int max_threads;</p>
  <p>And the usual pretty-up for code and documentation.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Release 6.2.1 December 2008</h2>
  <blockquote>
  <p>This release is just a smooth-up for some of the classes. That is, making 
  some protected fields private, streamlining some code, etc.</p>
  <p>We removed support for the Jini version 1.x examples. Jini version 2.x has 
  been available for many years now.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Release 6.2 November 2008</h2>
  <blockquote>
  <p>This release adds additional functionality for the Run Time Functions:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notification<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logging<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statistics Repository</p>
  <p>The run time functions load at Tymeac start up. We now provide three GUIs 
  (and command line access) to reset, stop, display and update (change) these 
  functions.</p>
  <p>
  <font color="#FF0000">Tymeac Interface (and all the implementation classes) 
  changed to accommodate the above. You must recompile any affected modules.</font></p>
  <p>
  <font color="#008000">As of the next release, we are removing support for the 
  Jini version 1.x examples. Jini version 2.x has been available for many years 
  now.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Release  6.1 October 2008</h2>
  <blockquote>
  <p>This release is a cosmetic upgrade to the server. More of a pretty-up for 
  the com.tymeac.base classes.</p>
  <p>The original Java code started in 1998 for JDK1.1. Ten years later some of 
  that code still functioned as-is (logging, statistics etc.) So we  brought 
  that old code into line with newer techniques. We changed all public fields from public to private.</p>
  <p>We added an uncaught exception handlers for the Monitor (to shut down Tymeac 
  in case of fatal Monitor errors) and Queue Threads (to log messages.)</p>
  <p>We fixed a potential bug is the server shut down logic when many requests 
  for shut down happen concurrently.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Release  6.0 April 2008</h2>
  <blockquote>
  <p>This release is a major upgrade to the server. It's been awhile since the 
  last upgrade. This release is based on JDK 1.6.</p>
  <p>We added the timeout variable in the Processing Application Class as an updateable field in the
  <a href="TyQueData.html">Queue Data</a> GUI/non-GUI. There was some minor 
  restructuring to support this in the TyBase Class.</p>
  <p>We added a high water mark field in the Wait Lists. This affects the
  <a href="TyWlData.html">Wait List</a> GUI/non-GUI and the <a href="Stats.html">
  statistics</a>.</p>
  <p>We added logical number of entries to the Wait List structure. This 
  requires alteration to both the <a href="DBMSQue.html">DBMS Queue Table</a> 
  and the <a href="UserQueues.html">User Queues</a> structure.
  <font color="#FF0000">You must alter these structures to use this release.</font></p>
  <p>Eliminated printing the name of the rebinding variable in the RMI Registry 
  and JNDI Rebinding message. It was causing some 
  confusion.</p>
  <p>When Queue Threads change status to &quot;Processing&quot; they reset the cancelled 
  reason.</p>
  <p>Removed the&nbsp;&quot;zero asynchronous requests possibly stalled&quot; message 
  displaying all the time from the Overall display. The message only appears now when there are possibly 
  stalled requests.</p>
  <p>Changed most 'public' constructors and other methods to 'protected' in 
  com.tymeac.base (for the Tymeac management Classes.) There is no reason 
  outside packages should access these Classes. We provide access to execution 
  information in the TymeacInfo and TymeacUserSingleton Classes as well as the 
  com.tymeac.client and com.tymeac.client.jframe packages.</p>
  <p>We added a demo/comparison between Tymeac and the new Fork-Join package 
  coming in Java 7 for early adapters.</p>
  <p>We include the complete source in the /Source directory as a zip file and 
  eliminate one downloadable file (the product without full source.) Previously, 
  we only supplied demonstration classes in the /Source. If users wanted the 
  complete source, then they downloaded that zip file separately.</p>
  <p>As with all software over time, we improved the readability, 
  maintainability and performance of the product.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Release 5.5 August 2007</h2>
  <blockquote>
  <p>This release is the last minor internal restructuring to the server that 
  was started in release 5.0.</p>
  <p>We restructured the Start up Class into six related classes. This helps in 
  maintaining and enhancing.</p>
  <p>We restructured the command line start up for the Jini Server. Before, the 
  command line arguments were in a configuration file. We moved these to the 
  command line were they really belong. <font color="#FF0000">For the Jini 
  Server, you need to make minor changes.</font></p>
  <p>We renamed and cleaned up several Classes.</p>
  <p>This is the last release using the Java5 (or 1.5) JDK. The next release 
  will be based on JDK 1.6.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Release 5.4 July 2007</h2>
  <blockquote>
  <p>This release is a minor internal restructuring to the server.</p>
  <p>We restructured the Tymeac Queue Area. We made the &quot;Area&quot; into a three 
  level structure.</p>
  <p>We restructure the Function Array Classes to be in line with the Collections 
  Framework.</p>
  <p>We're beginning the restructuring of the start-up Class. This beast will be 
  tamed.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Release 5.3 June 2007</h2>
  <blockquote>
  <p>This release is a minor upgrade to the server.</p>
  <p>We fixed a minor bug in the wait algorithm for Queue Threads to speed up 
  de-allocation of the thread when no work was present.</p>
  <p>We applied the patch that came out for release 5.2 for the NetBeans GUI 
  Demonstration classes.</p>
  <p>We restructured the way Request-Detail objects are created and maintained. 
  These object hold data associated with each request. The Eden-Space of the 
  garbage collector is so efficient, we take advantage of this.</p>
  <p>We restructure the Stall Array Classes to be in line with the Concurrency 
  Classes.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Release 5.2 March 2007</h2>
  <blockquote>
  <p>This release is a minor upgrade to the server.</p>
  <p>We added the embedded database shutdown for the Activation system. We 
  missed this in release 5.1.</p>
  <p>We added error recovery to the cancel sync request using a callback. See
  <a href="Cancel.html#sync">cancelSyncReq()</a>. The proper term should be that 
  we trapped the errors and printed a message.</p>
  <p>There can be no recovery from such errors. This functionality requires 
  internal Tymeac classes and if something goes wrong, it means there is system 
  damage.</p>
  <p>We changed the start up configuration file from a home-grown format to xml. 
  We said this was coming and here it is. Not to worry, we proved a conversion 
  tool for the old format. See the <a href="TyCfg.html">TyCfg</a> document for 
  the details. <font color="#FF0000">This means, naturally, that you must 
  convert the old format to xml before running this release.</font></p>
  <p>As stated in release 5.1, we're in the process of restructuring the GUI 
  classes. In this release we provide three Demonstration GUI's: T1,&nbsp; T3&nbsp; 
  and the Internal Server Test in 
  this new format. If the yelling and screaming doesn't reach lethal levels, 
  then we'll continue using this new format in future releases.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Release 5.1 January 2007</h2>
  <blockquote>
  <p>This release is a minor upgrade to the server.  </p>
  <p>There are some bug fixes. As we mentioned below, using no-lock/no-wait 
  logic is not as easy as it looks.</p>
  <p>We added support for embedded databases. Derby and Hsql are the ones we 
  concentrated on. Tymeac was first built with 
  the DBMS mode only. Using the standalone mode came later. We only tested with 
  DB2 and ran into some structure problems when adding Derby (DB2 allowed a 
  semi-colon (;) after commands, YEAR was a valid column name, etc.)
  <font color="#FF0000">Therefore, there are name changes to the Log and Stats 
  tables.</font></p>
  <p>We're in the process of restructuring the GUI classes. In the first release 
  of Tymeac we used AWT and VisualAge-for-Java for building those. Next we used 
  Swing and VisualCafe for the GUI's. Both those are no longer supported. We 
  liked both those products since they generated java files that could be 
  maintained without the products. We've decided on using NetBeans for 
  maintaining the GUI's. Even though NetBeans requires an 
  add-on jar file for execution, NetBeans is free and easily obtainable so there won't be a 
  problem for other developers.</p>
  <p>We're in the process of restructuring some of the base classes. Start-up is 
  one for sure.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Release 5.0 September 2006</h2>
  <blockquote>
  <p>This release is a major upgrade to the server. From a functionality 
  viewpoint, there is no difference. Tymeac looks the same. From an internal 
  viewpoint there are major differences. This release incorporates the 
  java.util.concurrent packages.</p>
  <p>In prior releases, there was only course grained locking; i.e. 
  synchronization. The volatile keyword did not work properly in releases prior 
  to Java5. If multiple threads wanted access to a shared variable, then both 
  the get() and put() methods needed to be synchronized.</p>
  <p>With Java5, volatile works properly so get() functionality need not lock 
  the variable in order to read the latest version. Tymeac uses volatile for 
  variables that are set() by one thread but read by many threads.</p>
  <p>The biggest boast in performance comes from the concurrency packages.</p>
    <blockquote>
  <p>All [RMI] Connection threads use CountDownLatch when waiting for Queue 
  Threads to finish processing in the Synchronous Request&nbsp; method. This 
  results in significant performance improvements.</p>
  <p>Queue Threads use Lock.lock() and 
  Condition.await()/signal() in place of wait()/notify() when waiting for work 
  from the [RMI] Connection threads. </p>
  <p>The Queue Wait Lists use ConcurrentLinkedQueue in place of a home-grown 
  pop-up list. </p>
  <p>All Synchronous/Asynchronous Request arrays and the Queue Threads 
  use atomic variables in place of synchronization wherever possible. (Which is 
  just about everywhere.)</p>
  <p>The performance is significantly greater. However, testing of this new 
  environment requires exhaustive work. We've done the best we can. Many strange 
  things happen in multi-processing -- beyond the ability of mere mortals to 
  envision. We look forward to your comments, corrections and suggestions.</p>
    </blockquote>
  <p>Added LoginServer: </p>
    <blockquote>
  <p>This is an example of how to use the RMI Server to front-end a login 
  sequence before the client may use the server. For those who do not use Jini's 
  extensible RMI (JERI) this is a way to easily do a login. </p>
    </blockquote>
  <p>Changed Monitor:</p>
    <blockquote>
  <p>Every iteration of the Monitor looked to compress the Tymeac internal 
  tables used for synchronous/asynchronous processing. This was heavy overhead 
  with very limited benefit. It also impacted the performance. We eliminated 
  this compression. </p>
    </blockquote>
  <p>Changed CancelParm class:</p>
    <blockquote>
  <p>Added cancel word long integer. There is no difference to users. Before, on 
  single param constructor, we used the request id to pass the cancel word. With 
  restructuring on the Server, we separated the two fields.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Release 4.0.5 November 2004</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Added the User Singleton class to help applications using persistent storage.</p>
    <p>Minor documentation enhancements.</p>
    <p>Minor speed and cosmetic code changes.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Release 4.0.4 October 2004</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Added a new shut down request method<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public String shutRequest(boolean force);</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>There were times when the server would not shut down because of unresponsive Queue
      Threads. This method forces a shutdown when the boolean is set to true.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>As started in release 4, a restructuring is taking place.</p>
    <p>Changed/restructured TyBase</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Added <br>
      public int shutOrigin = 0; // shutdown initiated by<br>
      public int startType = 0; // type of Server</p>
      <p>These were in TymeacInfo. From a pure user standpoint there is no change.</p>
      <p>Changed structure from public instance fields to private and added getter/setter
      methods.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Changed TymeacInfo</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Removed getBase()<br>
      Added getJoinManager() </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Removed instance fields<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private int status = 0;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private int shutOrigin = 0;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These were moved to TyBase.</p>
      <p>Removed constant <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public final static int NOT_IN_SHUTDOWN = 0;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The above two instance fields worked together. Some replacement logic for getStatus():</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Where TymeacInfo info = TymeacInfo.getInstance();<br>
        if (info == TymeacInfo.AVAILABLE ) // (not in shut down)<br>
        if (info &gt; TymeacInfo.AVAILABLE ) // (in shut down)<br>
        if (info == TymeacInfo.INITIALIZATION) // (not available)<br>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Changed the Jini shutdown exit:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; com.tymeac.serveruser.JiniShutDownExit <br>
    by replacing getBase() with getJoinManager() see the change to TymeacInfo, above.</p>
    <p>Changed shutThread<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no longer contains inactivate logic, that now is in
    TymeacImpl.shutRequest()</p>
    <p>Changed TymeacImpl.shutRequest() <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as above and streamlined<br>
    <br>
    Changed monitor<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; added shut_count for handling a shut down in the inactivate logic</p>
    <p>Minor documentation enhancements.</p>
    <p>Minor speed and cosmetic code changes.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Release 4.0.3 July 2004</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Changed the way Queue Threshold values are entered in both the Queue Maintenance and
    Live Queue displays. Previously, one had to enter the zero and decimal place for the
    floating point number (0.). Now only the fraction is necessary. 25% was 0.25, now is just
    25.<br>
    <strong>N.B. </strong>5% is 05, not 5.</p>
    <p>Changed the Monitor to exit in the run() method at the completion of Tymeac shut down.
    This only affects the internal server when not using the shut down thread.</p>
    <p>Minor documentation enhancements.</p>
    <p>Minor speed and cosmetic code changes.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Release 4.0.2 May 2004</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Support for java.util.Preference data which may replace the configuration file (for
    DBMS mode.)</p>
    <p>Added JavaDoc for some Tymeac base classes to help in documentation.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Release 4.0.1 April 2004</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Additional field in The Tymeac Parameter clients pass to the server to include the
    cancel word for canceling synchronous requests.</p>
    <p>Added support for Portable Object Adapter (IIOP).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Release 4.0&nbsp; March 2004</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>We support Jini2.0 and JDK1.4.2. This will be a major upgrade and policy shift.</p>
    <p>Our policy was that the binary release of Tymeac supported two prior releases of the
    JDK That is, when JDK1.3x was the current JDK. We supported backward to JDK1.1x. The
    binary classes of Tymeac were compiled with the JDK1.1 compiler. Therefore, customers who
    ran on prior releases of Java could still use the product.</p>
    <p>Henceforth, we will release versions of Tymeac on the latest version of the JDK.</p>
    <p>Those who are running on prior versions of the JDK can download prior versions of
    Tymeac. In this way, we can stay on the cutting edge of technology.</p>
    <p>This is mainly due to the Jini2.0 upgrade. Jini2.0 adds: <ul>
      <li>Support for secure Jini technology-based programs (a greatly enhanced Security
        infrastructure) </li>
      <li>Mechanisms to configure applications at run-time (<code>Configuration</code>) </li>
      <li>Unity of client-side and server-side programming models (<code>ProxyPreparer</code> and <code>Exporter</code>)
      </li>
      <li>An RMI implementation that supports pluggable invocation layer behavior and pluggable
        transport providers (Jini ERI) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Currently we have different front-ends for each [TCP, IIOP] transport provider. As RMI
    supports more and more communication protocols using an exporter is the right way to go.</p>
    <p>We add two directories:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">com.tymeac.jini.base<br>
      com.tymeac.jini.client</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It is our belief that Jeri, with its vast array of security options, is the best way to
    use a backend server. With this release we focus on the Jini Architecture as an integral
    part of the Tymeac System.</p>
    <h2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Enhancements:</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Additional method in TymeacInterface. In order to support the canceling of synchronous
      requests we added a new method<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="Cancel.html#sync">cancelSyncReq()</a>. (See the cancel
      document for details.)</p>
      <p>Altered method in TymeacInterface. In order to support the canceling of asynchronous
      requests<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; idStatus1Request(). By adding an integer, action to the parm. The
      action is 1.is to return the status of a request. The action 2 is to cancel the request.
      (See the <a href="Cancel.html">cancel document</a> for details.)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Addition of the TymeacInternalFunctions and Queues. This is to support the canceling of
      synchronous requests and any further internal functionality.</p>
      <p>Additional field in both the Tymeac <a href="TyCfg.html">Configuration File</a> (for
      use with a DBMS) and the Tymeac <a href="UserVariables.html">User Variables Class</a> (for
      stand alone mode.) The field is Login Context, for security checking.</p>
      <p>Added security checking in the Tymeac Server driven by the above, login context. Added
      security checking in the Tymeac Clients with a command line option. For both of these. see
      the <a href="Security.html">security document</a>.</p>
      <p>Jini is now part of the basic product. There is a JiniServer for both activatable and
      non-activation.</p>
      <p>Additional fields in the Tymeac Base Storage (TyBase) for security and Jini. The TyBase
      fields were all static, they are now instance.</p>
      <p>Additional field in The Tymeac Parameter clients pass to the server to include the
      callback for canceling synchronous requests.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Bug fixes:</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The bug in the Queue Thread when using an asynchronous request with no output agent
      queue has been fixed. The thread tried to store the result of processing into an array
      that was never initialized.</p>
      <p>The bug in the Queue building class method() has been fixed. It never loaded the
      PA_timeout value from the parameter.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The bug in the cfg file write() method has been fixed. It output comments in the wrong
      order.</p>
      <p>The bug in the _impl shutRequest() method has been fixed. It wrote statistics during
      Stage 1 and Stage 2 shutdown. Should only be Stage 2.</p>
      <p>Messages were restructured and wrong message/action were corrected.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Withdrawal of Support</h2>

      <p>The request for &quot;we'd rather do it ourselves&quot; for the statistics and log
      repositories has been answered.</p>
      <p>Previously, if you used a DBMS for storing the Queue and Function data, then the only
      option for the statistics and log was also a DBMS.&nbsp; If you used the user classes for
      storing the Queue and Function data, then the only option for the statistics and log was a
      file.</p>
      <p>With this release, if you used a DBMS for storing the Queue and Function data, then the
      you may use a DBMS, File, or do it yourself with a user exit class, for the statistics and
      log repositories.&nbsp; If you used the user classes for storing the Queue and Function
      data, then the you may use a File, or do it yourself with a user exit class, for the
      statistics and log repositories.</p>

      \Scripts\IIOP.</p>
      <p><strong>Throughpu</strong>t -- Since there is significant overhead in the CORBA
      Marshalling algorithms, performance is lower than when using a pure Java RMI.</p>

  <h2>Release 2.1.1&nbsp; March, 2001 -- enhancement upgrade</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Tymeac times several phases in the life of a Queue Thread.&nbsp; One of those events is
    the time a Queue Thread invokes a Processing Application Class.&nbsp; The maximum
    allowable time for this event is four times the Tymeac Monitor interval.&nbsp; Such that
    if the Tymeac Monitor interval is 60 seconds, than the allowable time is 240 seconds. When
    that time expires, Tymeac marks the status of the Queue Thread as
    &quot;cancelled&quot;.&nbsp; If the Queue Thread resumes processing then this status code
    is reset.</p>
    <p>For a &quot;process now&quot; system, this allowable time is more than sufficient in
    most cases.&nbsp; It is the other cases that customers require an alternative.&nbsp; This
    is the enhancement upgrade.</p>
    <p>To accommodate an alternative, each Queue may now have a timeout field.&nbsp; When this
    field is zero, Tymeac uses the system default.&nbsp; When this field is greater than zero,
    Tymeac uses the timeout field in place of the system default.</p>
    <p>In order to accommodate an additional field in the Queue definition, it is necessary to
    alter the basic structure of several classes in Tymeac.&nbsp; You may <strong>not</strong>
    apply this enhancement by just overlaying the new Queue Classes over the old classes. You
    must make changes to any Queue definitions <strong>currently in use</strong>.<ol>
      <li>The DBMS Queue definition -- add integer field PA_TIMEOUT to the <strong>end</strong> of
        the definition.&nbsp; You may optionally use a default value of zero, (0). Nullable may be
        yes or no.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>The internal Queue definition Classes:</li>

    <blockquote>

        <p><strong>TymeacIndividualQueue</strong> constructor 2, has a new parameter:&nbsp; <em>int
        u_pa_timeout</em>&nbsp; This is a read-only class.&nbsp; We mention it here since, when
        using the constructor, it contains an additional field.</p>
