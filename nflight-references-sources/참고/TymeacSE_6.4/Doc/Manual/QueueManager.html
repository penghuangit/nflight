<h1>Queue Manager</h1>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>

<p>Normally you think of a Queue as a list of pending requests with methods like 
add() and remove(). Priority Queues, Blocking Queues etc are supported in the 
java.util package.</p>

<p>Article: <a href="../Articles/PriQueArticle.html">High Performance Priority 
Queues in Java SE</a></p>

<p>Tymeac Queues are all that and more. Tymeac Queues are actually a Queue 
framework. That is, the list and everything else needed to sustain it. Tymeac Queues 
support :</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#pri">Priority</a></li>
        <li><a href="#thresh">Thresholds</a></li>
        <li><a href="#pool">Thread pools</a></li>
        <li><a href="#user">The User Code</a></li>
        <li><a href="#error">Error recover</a></li>
        <li><a href="#control">Control</a></li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>

<h3><a name="pri"></a>Priority</h3>
  <blockquote>

<p>A priority queue usually relies on some internal field for sorting. Every request 
that goes into the queue needs to compare to other requests already in the queue 
to see where it should go. Duplicate priorities generally resolve arbitrarily. 
That's slow, very limited and subject to FIFO errors.</p>

<p>Tymeac does not use the standard priority queue.</p>
    <blockquote>

<p>Tymeac uses separate Wait Lists. Each Wait List (ConcurrentLinkedQueue) is 
the priority. If supporting ten priorities, then we have ten Wait Lists. 
Priority 1, goes into Wait List 1, etc. By separating the work in this way we 
can do <a href="TyQueMaint.html#example">amazing things</a>. And you can support your own priority 
structure in the caller. (E.G. incoming comparators aaa - azz resolve to priority 1, etc.)</p>

<p>Both adding and removing are fast. Inquiry for each priority is fast. Tymeac 
handles the FIFO problem.</p>

<p>The Wait Lists are bounded. Having an unbounded entity means that we run out 
of memory before we know there is a problem. With Tymeac, a 'no Wait List 
available' condition&nbsp; is a recoverable exception. The easiest solution is 
to dynamically <a href="TyQueData.html">add more elements </a>to each Wait List.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>

<h3><a name="thresh"></a>Thresholds</h3>
  <blockquote>

<p>By having Wait Lists, we can easily support thresholds for controlling the 
number of threads executing at any given time.</p>

<p>Threads consume resources. They eat memory voraciously. Unless you have many, many free 
CPU's just waiting for work, threads compete for CPU cycles. They compete with 
each other for locks. The list goes on and on.</p>

<p>When a thread can process a request in a short time period, then using more 
than the minimum number of threads for a lightly loaded Queue is a waste of 
resources and may even slow down overall processing.</p>

<p>Tymeac supports <a href="TyQueMaint.html#threshold">thresholds</a> for 
keeping the number of competing threads under control. The <a href="Tuning.html">Tuning Document</a> discusses this in detail and 
gives many examples.</p>

  </blockquote>

<h3><a name="pool"></a>Thread Pools</h3>
  <blockquote>

<p>Traditional thread pools are like pools of sharks. You certainly wouldn't 
want to venture in there.</p>

<p><a href="ThreadMgmt.html">Managed threads</a> are the answer.</p>
  </blockquote>

<h3><a name="user"></a>User Class</h3>
  <blockquote>

<p>In Tymeac we call this the Processing Application Class.
<a href="Develop.html#pap">Developing Your Applications</a> discusses this in 
detail.</p>

<p>A Processing Application Class is the code you write to process the specifics 
of the application. A Tymeac managed thread uses reflection to invoke the main() 
method of your class.</p>

<p>This is the decoupling that is so important in good application design. You 
supply the application logic in a Processing Application Class. Tymeac handles 
the threading logic.</p>
  </blockquote>

<h3><a name="error"></a>Error Recovery</h3>
  <blockquote>

<p>This is the part that separates the men from the boys.</p>

<p>Tymeac separates your request&nbsp; (Tymeac Function) into its components (Tymeac Queue) and 
schedules each Tymeac Queue. If <a href="SchdFail.html">scheduling fails</a> on 
any Tymeac Queue, then Tymeac tries to back out the already scheduled Tymeac 
Queues.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Back out tries to remove the request from a Tymeac Queue Wait List if 
      the request hasn't started executing.</li>
      <li>If the request is already executing, Tymeac informs the managed thread 
      to ignore any returned objects from the application.</li>
      <li>If an asynchronous request, Tymeac informs the managed thread not to 
      start the Output Agent processing.</li>
      <li>The calling Client is informed of the <a href="Usage.html#broker">
      specific reason</a> for the failure.</li>
    </ul>

<p>Tymeac supports the timed request (syncRequest()). If the time expires before the request 
completes, Tymeac tries to back out the request, as above.</p>

<p>Tymeac supports the asynchronous or autonomous request (asyncRequest()). You call the Tymeac 
Server for a request and receive a &quot;was scheduled&quot; message in response. The 
actual processing takes place asynchronously.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What if something goes wrong in an asynchronous request? How would anyone 
know? Unlike the synchronous request where the Client gets the return data from 
the processing, the asynchronous request is on its own. When things go wrong in 
asynchronous requests, Tymeac puts the request into a <a href="Stalled.html">
Stall Array</a>. An administrator may then deal intelligently with the request.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>When exceptions occur, Tymeac doesn't just let the system print an ugly 
message and die. Tymeac catches exceptions, prints and
<a href="RunTime.html#log">logs</a> meaningful messages with
<a href="Messages.html">full documentation</a>, <a href="RunTime.html#notify">
notifies</a> administrators of the problem and tries recovery.</p>

<p>What if something goes wrong on the Client side and that Client needs to 
cancel an in-progress request? No problem. Tymeac supports <a href="Cancel.html">
cancelling requests</a>.</p>

<p>Tymeac uses a <a href="Monitor.html">Monitor</a> (daemon) that scans the 
environment periodically looking for problems, notifying administrators when 
problems (real or potential) exist and recovering resources.</p>
  </blockquote>

<h3><a name="control"></a>Control</h3>
  <blockquote>

<p>Tymeac provides seventeen <a href="Manual.html#frame">GUI's</a> (and 
programming access) to the server environment so users may view and alter 
parameters dynamically.</p>
    <blockquote>

<p>Need to track the request during it's life cycle? What stage of processing is 
that asynchronous request you sent? No problem.</p>

<p>Are any asynchronous requests stalled and can you view, reschedule or purge a 
request? No problem.</p>

<p>What is the load on each thread in the Queue? No problem.</p>

<p>Need to alter thread parameters? No Problem</p>

<p>What is the load on each Wait List in the Queue? No problem.</p>

<p>Need more Wait List elements? No problem.</p>

<p>Need to alter the Processing Application Class? No problem.</p>
    </blockquote>

<p>Tymeac is a professional product. Professionals know how important it is to 
provide total control over the Queue.</p>
