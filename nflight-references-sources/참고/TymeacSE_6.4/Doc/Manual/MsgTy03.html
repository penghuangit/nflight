    <p>The Monitor threw an unhandled exception (the exception is after the =). 
    A stack trace follows.</p>
    <p>Tymeac cannot run without the Monitor. Therefore, the exception handler 
    tries to shut down the system three times (normal shut down 
    shutRequest(false) with a delay in between each request.) The exception 
    handler then forces shut down with shutRequest(true).</p>
