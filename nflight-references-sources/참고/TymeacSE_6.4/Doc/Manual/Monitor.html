<h1><a name="top"></a>Tymeac Monitor</h1>

<hr color="#000000" width="20%">

<blockquote>
  <p>Tymeac is a pure application.&nbsp;There are no hooks, no operating system exits, nor
  special Java programs. This is in order that Tymeac may run without interfering with any
  existing exit routine and may run on any future release of RMI without modification.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Without accessing internal Java tables or using operating system exit routines a
  monitor facility is necessary for the use of <a href="#Threads">asynchronous threads</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tymeac start-up starts the Monitor Thread when the <a href="TyCfg.html#interval">monitor
  interva</a>l is greater than zero (use zero for testing when you need to trap 
  threads.)&nbsp;When the Monitor finds possible problems it <a href="RunTime.html#log">logs</a>&nbsp; messages. Therefore, the interval should be long
  enough not to interfere with normal execution.&nbsp;We recommend starting this interval at
  <u><strong>60 seconds</strong></u>. Your processing requirements determine the final
  value.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Monitor Thread examines each Queue.&nbsp;The code uses the Monitor Interval, or,
  one minute if the interval is less, as the time interval in determining when there may be
  a problem.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>You may alter the monitor interval at runtime by using the
  <a href="TyAltSvr.html">Alter Server Options</a> GUI. You may not alter this 
  value if you specified zero, above, since the monitor would not be running. 
  Also, altering the monitor interval after start up will have no affect on 
  determining when there may be a problem since these values are only set at 
  start up.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tymeac keeps track of the time of <a href="Disabled.html#five">several events</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Monitor examines each Wait List entry for a non performing Queue, i.e., no Queue
  Thread busy, posted, activated, or waiting, and, when an Asynchronous Request, it adds an
  entry to the <a href="Stalled.html">Stall Array</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><a name="sync"></a>The Monitor purges Synchronous Requests that exceed the wait_time
  (set in the <a href="TymeacParm.html">parameter</a> passed to Tymeac Server) by an
  excessive amount.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The amount is release dependent. However, it is always several times the wait_time
    parameter, or, twice the Monitor interval, whichever is greater.</p>
    <p>The logic here is that the caller is only willing to wait for the wait_time. Anything
    that happens thereafter is no longer relevant to the caller. Since the request is
    irrelevant, off with its head.</p>
    <p>Since there is a delay in purging a timed-out request, one may see the count of
    synchronous requests greater then those actually present in the system when viewing the
    overall Tymeac environment, <a href="TyOverall.html">TyOverall</a>.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Monitor purges Asynchronous Requests that were possibly stalled and 
  then finished.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p><a href="Stalled.html">See here for more detail on this.</a></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Monitor also purges requests that were cancelled but some Queues were still 
    executing at the time of the cancel.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>These may be both Synchronous or Asynchronous requests. For instance, you 
  cancel a request with three queues.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Queue-1 already completed.</li>
    <li>Queue-2 is executing.</li>
    <li>Queue-3 hasn't started and Tymeac removes the request from that queue.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Since one Queue is busy, Tymeac cannot free the resources until that 
  executing Queue finishes. The Queue Thread itself will try to free the 
  resources when it finishes, but this doesn't always happen. Hence, the Monitor 
  to the rescue.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Monitor handles the <a href="Shutdown.html#NB">de-activation procedure</a> 
  for an Activatable Server.</p>
  <p><b>You simply cannot run without the Monitor Thread in a production 
  environment.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>When things go wrong or when requests time-out or are cancelled 
  it is the Monitor Thread that cleans up the environment.</p>
  <p>Therefore, the Monitor Thread has an uncaught exception handler that shuts 
  down Tymeac when invoked. The handler tries several times to shut down 
  normally, then forces shut down. (See the <a href="Shutdown.html">shut down 
  document</a> for shut down details.)</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify"><a name="details"></a>Details</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tymeac performs two important services as a Backend Server:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>memory management and </li>
    <li>thread management.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4 style="text-align: justify">Memory management</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>When Tymeac receives a new request it must save the parameters of that request for the
    Queues (basically the input Object from the client.) Tymeac also allocates resources to
    keep track of the progress of the request. Tymeac saves the output Objects from the Queues
    to return to the requester (synchronous request) or to pass on to the Output Agent
    (asynchronous request.)</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">Normally, the End-Point Connection thread<sup><a href="#f1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight:700">1</a>
    </sup>handles the allocation of resources.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">For synchronous requests this thread also handles the
    freeing of resources (making available to the garbage collector.)</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">However, when a synchronous request times-out or is
    cancelled the following occurs:<ol>
      <li>Tymeac attempts to back out<sup><a href="#f2" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight:700">2</a></sup> all the Queues that have not
        finished processing.</li>
      <li>Tymeac forms a return Object array containing the Objects from the completed Queues.</li>
      <li>All the resources (Tymeac storage, client input Object, Queue output Objects) remain <em>in
        case a currently executing Queue Thread needs access to any resource</em>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p style="text-align: justify">It is the Monitor that eventually cleans up this storage.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left">For asynchronous requests the last Queue Thread to finish
    in the request handles the freeing of resources (making available to the garbage
    collector.)</p>
    <p style="text-align: left">However, when an asynchronous request fails scheduling or
    stalls, the resources remain. See the <a href="Stalled.html">Stall Array</a>.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">Once again, it is the Monitor that eventually cleans up
    this storage.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h4 style="text-align: justify"><a name="Threads"></a>Thread management</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Multi-threading is a potential nightmare.&nbsp;The only truly effective way to control
    a thread of execution is at the operating system level. Time slicing, preempting,
    prioritizing, recognizing the stall, etc. -- these functions are most difficult to control
    at the thread level.</p>
    <p>In an applet or GUI application multi-threading is both easy and safe. If a thread
    hangs or misbehaves, simply close the window and start over. Using a separate thread as a
    listener is preferable.</p>
    <p>It is on the server side that multi-threading can get out of control. Threads can hang,
    abnormally terminate or stall and the client may never know. It is for these reasons that
    Tymeac <a href="Disabled.html#five">times</a> the functions in the<a href="Tuning.html#cycle"> life of a thread</a>.</p>
    <p>Since Tymeac has no operating system hooks, the next best way to control the threads on
    a backend Server is with a Monitor<sup><a href="#f3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight:700">3</a></sup> thread.</p>
    <p>It is the Monitor that examines the Tymeac threading environment, flags potential
    problems and notifies users through the <a href="TyNotify.html">Notification Function</a>.</p>
