      <p>Tymeac Asynchronous Request processing is a background function.&nbsp;There is no
      timing for the Tymeac Function.&nbsp;Therefore, when something goes wrong, Tymeac uses an
      alternate method to recover.&nbsp;This section discusses that alternative.</p>
      <p>The Stall Array is a list of Asynchronous Requests.</p>

  <blockquote>

      <p>The Stall Array is both an in-doubt as well as a hard stall mechanism for <a href="Definitions.html#async">Asynchronous Requests</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="first"></a>The <strong>first</strong> situation arises during initial
  scheduling.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Tymeac Server adds an entry to this array during back-out processing, when
    in-doubt.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Back-out occurs when a Queue, within a Function, <a href="SchdFail.html">fails
    scheduling</a>. The Tymeac Server informs all previously scheduled Queue's to ignore
    processing.&nbsp;If the request is in a Wait List, then Tymeac removes it. In the small
    window between the time the application class finishes processing but before the Queue
    Thread can update the status, the Tymeac Server is in doubt whether it can safely release
    resources.&nbsp;The Tymeac Server places an entry in the Stall Array.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The <a href="Monitor.html">Monitor</a> Thread cleans-up such an entry when the Queue
    Thread updates the status.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>An <strong>example</strong> is helpful.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Tymeac Function, &quot;Function_6&quot;, in the <a href="Demo.html">Demonstration</a>
      System uses two Queues, 'AAAA' and 'BBBB'.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>When there is a request for &quot;Function_6&quot;:</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The user-written Tymeac Client application forms the <a href="TymeacParm.html">parameters</a>
      needed by the Tymeac Server and does an <a href="TySvrComm.html">asyncRequest</a>.&nbsp;When
      all Tymeac Queues successfully schedule, the Tymeac Server returns to the user-written
      client application. The application may inform the requester that the request scheduled
      and free the connection for other work.</p>
    </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>However, the following may occur:</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Tymeac Server determines that the Function consists of two Tymeac Queues.&nbsp;The
      Tymeac Server schedules&nbsp;Queue 'AAAA'; scheduling complete. The Tymeac Server
      schedules Queue 'BBBB'; scheduling fails (see Scheduler <a href="Usage.html#schd">Return
      Codes</a>).</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This Function cannot complete successfully.&nbsp;A back-out of all previously scheduled
      Queues is desirable either to avoid unnecessary processing when the request is in a
      Queue's Wait List pending execution, or, to limit the amount of post-application
      processing done by the <a href="Definitions.html#quethread">Queue Thread</a>.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In this example, Queue 'AAAA' is the only previously scheduled Queue in need of
      back-out processing.&nbsp;The Tymeac Server attempts to back-out Queue 'AAAA' by removing
      the Wait List entry.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>When it finds the entry and removes it, the back-out is successful.&nbsp;When a
        successful back-out occurs, the Tymeac Server frees all associated resources.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>When an <u>unsuccessful</u> back-out occurs, the Tymeac Server cannot free the
      request's resources without the possibility of jeopardizing system integrity.&nbsp;That
      is, a Queue Thread may be reading the input&nbsp;Object or updating internal tables. The
      stage of processing for the request is unknown.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This may simply be a case where one Thread is locking a resource and another Thread is
      waiting on that lock before it updates the resource.&nbsp;This is only a problem in that
      the Tymeac Server cannot free valuable system resources at this time.&nbsp;Therefore, the
      Tymeac Server adds an entry to the Stall Array.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>When the Queue Thread for Queue 'AAAA' finishes processing the request, it determines
      that no further Queues remain for the request, and the request is 'in error'. Therefore,
      the Queue Thread frees the request's resources.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The entry in the Stall Array remains.&nbsp;However, no resources for the request
      remain.&nbsp; When the Monitor Thread runs, it deletes the Stall Array Entry.</p>

  <p><a name="second"></a>The <strong>Second</strong> situation arises during the
  Monitor Thread scan of Tymeac resources.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Monitor Thread places an entry in the Stall Array when in-doubt.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Tymeac is a process <u>now</u> system.&nbsp;The Monitor Thread examines the Tymeac
    System for entries remaining for a lengthy period and adds an entry to the Stall Array
    when &quot;this has been here much too long&quot;.&nbsp;An example of a request remaining
    for a <a href="Disabled.html#five">lengthy period</a> is a situation caused by an loop in
    an <a href="Definitions.html#pap">Processing Application Class</a> or an operating system
    purge outside of this image.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>When Tymeac flags the Asynchronous Request due to lengthy processing time in
    applications (that is, the Request is not hanging, it is just taking a long time) then
    this Stall Array Entry should be ignored. The Monitor Thread eventually cleans-up this
    entry.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="center"><img src="Images/divider.gif" alt="divider.gif (931 bytes)" width="100" height="5"></p>
  <p><a name="third"></a>The <strong>Third</strong> situation arises during the scheduling
  of the <a href="Definitions.html#oa">Output Agent</a> Queue. This is not an in-doubt
  situation but a hard stall. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>When Tymeac flags an Asynchronous Request due to a <a href="SchdFail.html">failure to
    schedule</a> the Output Agent Queue, then recovery and re-scheduling are possible.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Output Agent Queue is the Tymeac Queue that processes the combined output of all
    the previously executed asynchronous component processes of the Function.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The last Queue Thread to finish processing schedules the Output Agent Queue. However,
    when <a href="SchdFail.html">scheduling fails</a>, the Asynchronous Request
    stalls.&nbsp;The Queue Thread puts the stalled request into the Stall Array and writes<a href="MsgTy06.html"> messages</a> to the <a href="DBMSLog.html">Log</a> and <a href="RunTime.html#notify">Notification</a> facility.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>After the system administrator resolves the problem with the Output Agent Queue, the
    Stalled Request Display (<a href="TyStalled.html">TyStalled</a>) '<strong>ReSchd OA'</strong>
    button, attempts to re-schedule the Output Agent Queue.&nbsp; This may finish the request.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="center"><img src="Images/divider.gif" alt="divider.gif (931 bytes)" width="100" height="5"></p>
  <p><a name="fourth"></a>The <strong>Fourth</strong> situation arises when a Processing
  Application Class abnormally terminates.&nbsp;This is a hard stall.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Through decades of experience we know there is no such thing as a secure computer
    system.&nbsp; Therefore, when an application abnormally terminates (that is: it does not
    catch an exception or re-throws an exception) the potential for system damage is great.</p>
    <p>Tymeac's response to an exception in a Processing Application Class is to flag the
    Queue Thread (in which it executes) as &quot;<a href="Disabled.html">disabled</a>&quot;,
    terminate the [physical] Queue Thread, <a href="DBMSLog.html">Log</a> and print the error,
    and, add an entry to the Stall Array.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>It is the designers responsibility to handle all exceptions in Processing Application
      Classes.&nbsp;In a multi-threading application it is often difficult to pin point the
      cause of the crash without a record.&nbsp;This is like an airplane's &quot;black box&quot;
      after a crash.&nbsp;If there is no Tymeac Log in use and no Tymeac error printing (console
      window) then user logging is vital.&nbsp;Tymeac cannot diagnose application errors.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>After the system administrator resolves the problem with the Processing Application
    Class, the Queue Thread Class (<a href="TyQueThd.html">TyQueThd</a>) '<strong>enable all'</strong>
    button instantiates and, when there are pending requests in the Wait Lists, activates a
    new Queue Thread for the Queue.</p>
    <p align="center">
    <img src="Images/divider.gif" alt="divider.gif (931 bytes)" width="100" height="5"></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><a name="fifth"></a>The <strong>Fifth</strong> situation arises when an 
  AsyncRequest is cancelled. This is an in-doubt situation. </p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Prior to release 5.0 we used a course grained locking mechanism for 
  controlling access to Tymeac resources. Basically, we &quot;locked&quot; the environment 
  when we added a new request to the system as well as when we cancelled a 
  request. This way we were sure of what parts of the request were never run, 
  running and finished. Therefore, we could be sure when we cancelled a request 
  that no Queue Threads needed resources and those resources could be freed.</p>
  <p>As of release 5.0 the environment is no longer &quot;locked&quot; during cancel 
  processing. When Tymeac can remove every part of the request before any Queue 
  Threads begin processing, then Tymeac may safely free the resources. 
  Otherwise, Tymeac is once again &quot;in doubt&quot; whether it can free the resources 
  so the AsyncRequest resources are left alone. The Monitor may remove these 
  resources after the last Queue Thread finishes but it may also add a stall 
  array entry if any doubt remains.</p>
