<h1>Tymeac Product Glossary</h1>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Definitions herein are the Tymeac terms used throughout this manual. There is no
    separate glossary of computer, operating system, and Java terms.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="sync"></a>Synchronous Request</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Tymeac Server returns the response (Object array) to the Tymeac Client Application
  Class that initiated the request.</p>
  <p>This is a request_with_wait for completion.<ul>
    <li>The initiating Client Application Class uses a direct call or RMI to invoke the
      Synchronous Request method of the Tymeac Server to perform a Function. The Client waits
      for the Function to complete.</li>
    <li>Part of the parameter passed to the Tymeac Server is the maximum time the Client can
      wait.</li>
    <li>The Tymeac Server returns a reply indicating whether the request scheduled properly and
      completed within the time allocated, along with the response (Object array) of all the
      Queues in the Function.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="async"></a>Asynchronous Request</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Tymeac Server does <strong>not</strong> return the response (Object array) to the
  Tymeac Client Application Class that initiated the request. (However, the response may be
  passed to an <u>Output Agent</u> Queue, see below.) </p>
  <p>This is a request_without_wait for completion. <ul>
    <li>The initiating Client Application Class uses RMI to invoke the Asynchronous Request
      method of the Tymeac Server to perform a Function. </li>
    <li>The reply from the Tymeac Server indicates whether the request scheduled properly and
      contains data useful for tracing the request. There is no time correlation between the
      Client request and the final processing reply.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4>Asynchronous Thread</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no time correlation between the initiating Client and the processing Server
  thread.&nbsp;There is <u><em>no</em> <em>contact</em></u> between Client and
  thread.&nbsp;Tymeac manages the threads, on the RMI Server, that process the Client's
  request.</p>
  <p>As opposed to a synchronous thread that a Client may start itself, control itself, and
  terminate itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="client"></a>Client Application Class</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>The user-written Class that develops a need for Tymeac processing either internally or
  through interfacing with the network and requests a Tymeac Function through the Internal
  or RMI Tymeac Server.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="broker"></a>Tymeac Server Request Broker</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>That part of the Tymeac Server that separates a complex request from the Client
  Application Class into its component processes (Queues) for scheduling.</p>
  <p>For Synchronous Requests, it waits for all Queues to complete. Then it combines the
  output of the component processes into an Object array and passes that array back to the
  Client Application Class.</p>
  <p>For Asynchronous Requests, it passes data useful for tracing the request back to the
  Client Application Class.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="sched"></a>Tymeac Server Scheduling</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>That part of the Tymeac Server that receives Tymeac Queue scheduling requests from the
  Request Brokering section of the Server, or, from the last Queue Thread to finish an
  asynchronous request (to schedule the <u>Output Agent</u> Queue, see below).&nbsp;The
  Scheduler physically schedules those requests on the Queue by placing the request into a
  Wait List according to the requests' priority and notifying any waiting Queue Thread.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="queue"></a>Tymeac Queue</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Queue consists of :<ol>
    <li>The instance of the Processing Application Class that performs the user's component work
      as a Reflect invoked Class.&nbsp;This Class executes inside a Tymeac Queue Thread.</li>
    <li>A logical anchor point for the Queue's Threads.</li>
    <li>A group of prioritized lists (Wait Lists) where the Tymeac Server stacks client
      component requests that are subsequently fetched by the Queue Threads.</li>
    <li>Four thresholds variables (associated with the Wait Lists) to determine when to activate
      a new Queue Thread.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="lists"></a>Wait Lists</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>A group of prioritized lists, for each Queue, where the Tymeac Server stacks client
  requests.&nbsp;The Queue Threads then fetch each request starting at the first list
  (priority one.)</p>
  <p>Each Queue must have at least one Wait List. The user defines the number of Wait Lists
  and number of buckets in each Wait List. All Wait Lists use FIFO processing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="function"></a>Tymeac Function</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>A list of Tymeac Queues needed to accomplish the final result.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="quethread"></a>Queue Thread</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Tymeac asynchronous thread, associated with a Tymeac Queue, that handles direct
  requests from the Scheduler, indirect requests by way of Wait Lists, timed suspensions
  when no work is pending, and manages the invocation to the Processing Application Class.</p>
  <p>For Synchronous Requests, the Queue Thread passes the return Object of the user-written
  Processing Application Class back to the Request Brokering section of the Tymeac Server. </p>
  <p>For Asynchronous Requests, the Queue Thread holds the return Object of the user-written
  Processing Application Classes until all associated Queue Threads finish.&nbsp;Then it
  Schedules the <u>Output Agent</u> (see below) Queue, if any, passing the Agent the
  concatenated return Objects [array] of all the Queues.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="pap"></a>Processing Application Class</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>The user-written Class that executes the component process of the request.&nbsp;The
  Queue Thread invokes this Class using Reflection, (java.lang.reflect.Method invoke()
  ).&nbsp;The single parameter to the main() method of this Class is the Object from the
  original request (parameter passed either directly or by RMI .)&nbsp;The method returns an
  optional Object.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">public static Object main(Object[] args) {}</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h4 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="oa"></a>Output Agent </h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Tymeac Queue Thread that concatenates the return Objects of the asynchronous
  component processes for Asynchronous Requests into an input message (Object[]) and invokes
  the Processing Application Class for further user-determined processing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monitoring</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Tymeac Thread that scans the internal Tymeac system looking for potential problems.</p>
