  Two common uses for application threads on a Backend Server are the timing of requests and
  the autonomous request, with or without callback.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <h4>Timing:</h4>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>When timing a request, the Client thread cannot time itself.&nbsp; If it gets caught in
      a long or never ending loop then it may not be able to break out of the code when the time
      expires. &nbsp; Therefore, it is necessary for the Client thread to start a new
      application thread.&nbsp; The Client thread may time the new thread and if the time
      expires the request does not complete.</p>
      <p>This seems simple enough.&nbsp; However, there are serious problems with this approach.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>For every request there is a new application thread. The VM must create and destroy
        every thread.&nbsp; This overhead puts a severe strain on resources.&nbsp; There may come
        a time when the VM cannot sustain any more threads and the entire VM becomes unusable.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p style="text-align: justify">[Some developers may put the timing code in the client.
          &nbsp; Rather than have a standard timing mechanism on the server, each client application
          must add proprietary timing code.] </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>What happens to the threads that time-out?&nbsp; If there is problem with a resource
        that the threads require before completing, then, once again, there may come a time when
        the VM cannot sustain any more threads and the entire VM becomes unusable.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p style="text-align: justify">[Even with the timing code in the client, the Client
          threads still hang.]</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <h4>Autonomous requests:</h4>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The only way to schedule this background task is to start a new application thread and
      inform the client that the request is pending.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Again, this seems simple enough.&nbsp; Again, there are serious problems with this
      approach.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p style="text-align: justify">The thread overload problem is the same as with the timed
        request, above.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p style="text-align: justify">The thread stall problem, as above, is even more serious.
        Since there is no time-out, the clients never know there is a problem.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p style="text-align: justify">Clients waiting for a notification need a way to inquire of
        the status of their request.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To handle these problems one must manage the application environment.<ul>
      <li>There must be a thread-limit parameter to avoid thread overload.&nbsp; There should be a
        queuing mechanism with thread initiation according to load, not chance.</li>
      <li>There must be a way to notify clients before the situation gets out of control.</li>
      <li>There must be a way to dynamically alter the parameters as business needs change.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Tymeac<small><sup>&#153;</sup></small></strong> is that manager.</p>

  <img src="Images/whitedot.gif" alt="whitedot.gif (103 bytes)" width="12" height="12">&nbsp;
  Another use for application threads on a Backend Server is parallelism.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <h4>Parallelism:</h4>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Often a request requires more than a simple compute or fetch from a resource. The
      request may need several methods.&nbsp; For linear programming, one method simply follows
      the other.&nbsp; However, by making each method a thread, one may take advantage of
      multi-programming and multi-processing capable machines.</p>
      <p>Creating a thread for each method in Java<small><sup>&#153;</sup></small> is very easy.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>However, all the problems with threads mentioned above are relevant here as well.&nbsp;
        In addition, the Client thread must now monitor multiple application threads and
        concatenate any return values from these threads for the client.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To handle these problems one must design a full-feature application manager.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Tymeac<small><sup>&#153;</sup></small></strong> is
    that manager.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><img src="Images/divider.gif" alt="divider.gif (931 bytes)" width="100" height="5"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a name="persist"></a>
  <img src="Images/whitedot.gif" alt="whitedot.gif (103 bytes)" width="12" height="12">&nbsp;
  The Backend Server environment is persistent.&nbsp;Applications can take advantage of this
  persistence to store common variables that drive processing</p>
  <blockquote>
    <h4>Persistence:</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Could you use connection pools for your JDBC work thereby saving cycles and
      memory?&nbsp; Could you use common storage to keep track of how many messages are
      outstanding within a Message Queuing start/stop sequence?&nbsp; Could you use common
      storage as a work area between threads?</p>
      <p>Managing the common variables including how threads access and update that storage
      requires a great deal of time and effort outside the pure application development area.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To handle persistent storage properly one must manage the Backend Server environment.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Tymeac<small><sup>&#153;</sup></small></strong> is
    that manager.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="center"><img src="Images/divider.gif" alt="divider.gif (931 bytes)" width="100" height="5"></p>
  <p><a name="recur"></a>
  <img src="Images/whitedot.gif" alt="whitedot.gif (103 bytes)" width="12" height="12">&nbsp;
  Recursion is one of the most useful techniques and sometimes the most difficult to
  implement.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <h4>Recursion:</h4>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>When the current process itself requires another asynchronous process, the effort
      required in keeping track of allocated storage, time-out, back-out, etc., means that
      designers usually chose some other, less efficient method.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To handle recursion one must manage the entire application environment.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Tymeac<small><sup>&#153;</sup></small></strong> is
    that manager.</p>

  <p><a name="debug"></a>
  <img src="Images/whitedot.gif" alt="whitedot.gif (103 bytes)" width="12" height="12">&nbsp;
  Debugging, Recovery and Tuning on a Backend Server can be a developer's worst nightmare.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <h4>Debugging:</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>How does one trap the application thread when one doesn't know which thread is
      currently handling this request?&nbsp; There is always trial and error.&nbsp; There is
      always println().&nbsp; There is always setting a breakpoint at the beginning of the code
      and walking all the way through.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4 style="text-align: justify">Recovery:</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Recovery assumes that one is in control of the situation, catches the exception,
      backs-out valuable resources and restores the proper state. &nbsp; Without a proper
      management facility, the assumption is false.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4 style="text-align: justify">Tuning:</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Tuning starts with designing for tuning.&nbsp; Without tuning as a prime thought in the
      design phase, there is no tuning in the execution stage. &nbsp; Throwing hardware at the
      problem, (E.G. adding more memory, more file space, etc.), only works for a while.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To handle these problems requires a total management package.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Tymeac<small><sup>&#153;</sup></small></strong> is
    that manager.</p>

  <p><a name="picture"></a>
  <img src="Images/whitedot.gif" alt="whitedot.gif (103 bytes)" width="12" height="12">&nbsp;
  A picture is worth a thousand words.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <h4>Picture:</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>What is the status of an autonomous request?&nbsp; What requests are stalled?&nbsp;
      What is the current thread load?&nbsp; How many requests are currently backed up?&nbsp;
      Can we get a &quot;snap shot&quot; of the overall queuing environment usage?&nbsp; Is
      there a log?&nbsp; Etc.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Building these pictures requires so much effort on the part of the development team
        that it overshadows the service it is meant to serve.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Tymeac<small><sup>&#153;</sup></small></strong> is a manager that provides
    logging and statistics as well as dozens of GUI and non-GUI classes to give administrators
    not only a picture of the environment but the means to alter that environment.</p>
