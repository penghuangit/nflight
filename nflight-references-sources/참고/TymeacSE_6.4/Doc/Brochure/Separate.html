  <h2>Why separate the Endpoint Connection thread from the Application?</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>(The Endpoint Connection thread may be TCP, HTTP, HTTPS, IIOP or even a local thread.)</p>
      </blockquote>

  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>What if the Endpoint Connection thread hangs in a never-ending loop? </li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The calling thread would also hang and require intervention.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>What if the Endpoint Connection thread needs a new thread itself? </li>

      <tr>
        <td style="FONT-SIZE: smaller; FONT-FAMILY: Arial, sans-serif" vAlign="top" align="left">This
        is the thread overload problem (i.e. where so many threads are executing that the System
        cannot sustain anymore threads or these threads cause so much competition for resources
        that the environment effectively stalls.)</td>

      <p>The thread create/destroy overhead may bog down<br>
      the application processing.</p>

      threads. (see sidebar) </p>

  <ul>
    <li>What if the Endpoint Connection thread needs timing? </li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Threads cannot time themselves at the same level. If they hang in a never-ending loop
      or block then there would be no way to interrupt them. By creating a new timer thread, we
      run into the problem mentioned above.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>What is the status of the current request? </li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>An outside inquiry into the status of a particular request would be very difficult at
      best. Just trying to locate the thread associated with a particular request would be a
      major undertaking. Then trying to determine the status thereof would require a mountain of
      code.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>What is the status of a prior request? </li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>If you thought the above current request was difficult, now add a history.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>How can others inquire about the overall health of the environment? </li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This means getting the status of each current request (see above). Then looking at
      every resource in the system for loading. Then analyzing requests/loading and generating a
      report.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Where is the congestion?</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>What if an application is hitting on some resource beyond what that resource can handle
      and there is a backlog? The only way to know where the congestion lies is to look at every
      connection and analyze the processing. That means getting the status of each current
      request, see above.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>How to detect and recover from stalls with autonomous requests (a situation in which a
      request is unable to complete)? </li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Timing a request (see above) is the best method to catch the stall except when the
      request is autonomous. Now there is no Endpoint Connection thread to time. So, here we go
      again trying to get the status of each current request and determine whether it is able to
      complete.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>How to tune this multi-threading environment?</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>You must be kidding. How would you limit the number of threads for each application?
      How would you put your resources exactly where they are needed depending on the current
      load? Perhaps you have the time and energy to tackle these issues.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>How may the threading environment quiesce and shut down gracefully? </li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>If you have no effective control over what comes into the system and you have no
      effective control over the threading environment itself, then your only option for shut
      down is to end the Java Virtual Machine.</p>
    </blockquote>

  <p><strong>By separating the Endpoint Connection thread from the application processing
  with Tymeac all these questions have a simple answer.</strong><ul>
    <li><p align="left">The Endpoint thread can never hang since it is not doing the work.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">The Endpoint thread can never need a new thread itself since it is not
      doing the work.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">The Endpoint thread is already timed.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">The Endpoint thread doesn't have a status. It is the application that
      has a status and Tymeac keeps the status of each request both synchronous and autonomous.
      This means that there is a history for prior requests.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Tymeac keeps a log. Requests for the status of prior autonomous requests
      is easy.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Tymeac provides over a dozen GUI and non-GUI methods for users to
      inquire about the health of their system and to pinpoint congestion.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Tymeac times the autonomous request so that stalls are detectable and
      recoverable.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Tymeac provides administrators the tools necessary to finely tune their
      systems.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Tymeac provides a two stage shut down with user exits for individual
      needs.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
