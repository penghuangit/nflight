    <p><strong>Why segregate an application?</strong> <ul>
      <li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255)">When a&nbsp; portion of your application has outgrown
        a single system's processing capability. </span></li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Your current application started out as a small process required by a select set of
        users.&nbsp; Those users were so happy with this application that they expounded the
        benefits to others.&nbsp; Then those others wanted access to the application, but, also
        needed additional functionality.</p>
        <p>Now as more and more users require more and more functionality, the application no
        longer fits on the original processor.&nbsp; There are two common solutions:<ol>
          <li>Get a bigger processor.</li>
          <li>Split the processing among several machines.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The second solution is by far the best.&nbsp; Once the application can run on two
        separate processors, it is relatively easy to further scale the application when more
        processor power is necessary.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255)">When a&nbsp; portion of your application has special
        processor requirements or needs to be readily portable. </span></li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Some applications require extensive computational functionality such as vector
        processing.&nbsp; The average processor does not have this feature.&nbsp; Giving
        applications the ability to load-up a special processor with only this heavy portion of
        the functionality can easily justify the cost of this machine.</p>
        <p>When the above computational functionality needs moving to a mainframe during
        exceptional use periods, portability is paramount.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255)">When a&nbsp; portion of your application needs
        isolating because of security or data access reasons.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Security is a concern for every company.&nbsp; The simplest method to secure an
        application is to place it on its own virtual machine.&nbsp; This is coarse grain
        security.</p>
        <p>Another coarse grain security feature is to restrict sensitive data to a select machine
        and only allow the local virtual machines access.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255)">When a&nbsp; portion of your application needs needs a
        background function.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Timing of requests and the autonomous request are the standard background functions.</p>
        <p>Request brokering with multi-threading is fast becoming the most popular method of
        processing.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255)">When an application needs concurrent access by a
        multitude of clients with load balancing.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Scalability is difficult.&nbsp; With concurrent access to your facility from clients
        all over the world at all times of the day, being able to segment the application onto
        multiple machines is mandatory.&nbsp; As more and more clients access the application,
        bringing more machines on-line and balancing the load is the solution.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255)">When a large and/or complex application needs to
        implement a structure of independent agents.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Agents are independent.&nbsp; Using a series of RMI Servers each with agent
        capabilities means that an application may start the &quot;function&quot; here and have
        each agent process a unique part of the application.&nbsp; Communication flows between
        agents until the &quot;function&quot; completes.</p>
