    <p><strong>GUI application</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Frame and JFrame are worthless without the support structure that precedes them. &nbsp;
      These include four interfaces and hundreds of methods and fields.&nbsp; Trying to build
      this environment for each GUI application as it becomes necessary is impossible. Even
      copying methods from one application to another may result in errors.</p>
      <p>The only truly effective procedure is to design the framework first, then any kind of
      GUI application may live inside.&nbsp; This is exactly what the designers of the language
      did.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Backend application</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The same holds true for backend application development.</p>
      <p>A basic support system for an application includes an operating system, access methods,
      (file/DBMS) and communication facilities.&nbsp; These comprise the concrete and steel
      infrastructure of software systems.</p>
      <p>Additional necessities include logging, messaging, event timing/monitoring,
      tuning/statistics, anomaly notification, recovery/restart, real time swapping of modules
      and many more.</p>
      <p>Trying to put these in later is awkward and prone to error.</p>
      <p>The best&nbsp; solution is to have a general purpose, full-feature, low-overhead and
      easy to use framework into which your applications can fit.</p>
