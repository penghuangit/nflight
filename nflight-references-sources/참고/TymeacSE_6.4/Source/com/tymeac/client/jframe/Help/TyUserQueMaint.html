<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Class</strong> <strong>Name</strong> -- The name of the user-written Processing
  Application Class the Tymeac Queue Thread or Output Agent Thread invokes to process the
  user request. &nbsp; This class must have a public static main() method that accepts an
  array of Objects and returns an Object:</p>

      <p>public static Object main(Object[] args)</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This also means that other methods used by main() must be static.&nbsp; See the section
    on classes in Developing your System.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no other restrictions for
    methods in this class or for inheritance.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The <u>single</u> Object passed to this method is the input data in the parameter used
    to remotely invoke Tymeac, TymeacParm.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The returning Object may be null.&nbsp; For an Output Agent Class, described next, the
    return Type may be void.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The Demonstration classes, (Demo*), are examples.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Timeout Value</strong> --&nbsp; The time, in seconds GREATER THAN ZERO, the
  Processing Application Class may execute before Tymeac believes the Class may be stalled.
  ZERO is to use the system default.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>For the majority of cases, the system default is sufficient.&nbsp; If the need arises,
    then this field is available to adjust the processing needs of individual Queues.</p>
    <p>Tymeac is a process NOW system.&nbsp; Tymeac keeps track of the time this Class begins
    executing.&nbsp; When that time exceeds this value, then Tymeac marks the thread in which
    this class is executing as &quot;cancelled&quot;.&nbsp; When next the Monitor runs, it
    marks the thread as &quot;disabled.&quot;&nbsp; If the thread resumes processing, the
    thread resets the entry, irrespective of any prior setting.&nbsp; These status codes have
    to do with scheduling. &nbsp; A thread with a status of &quot;cancelled or disabled&quot;
    may not participate in scheduling.</p>
    <p>When all threads have a status of &quot;cancelled or disabled&quot;, then the Queue is
    no longer functional, (Scheduling failure).&nbsp; One must determine the cause of the
    stall, repair the faulty component and enable the &quot;disabled&quot; threads.</p>

  <p><strong>Output Agent - Not checked is No / Is checked is Yes</strong> -- Yes -
  designates this an Output Agent Queue <u><em>for Asynchronous Requests</em></u>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Processing is much different for an Output Agent. &nbsp; This is the Queue that
    receives the combined output of all the other Queue's in a Tymeac Function, <em>f</em>or <em>an
    Asynchronous Request</em>.&nbsp; When the last Queue in the Function's List of Queues
    finishes processing and there is an Output Agent Queue for this Function, then Tymeac
    schedules that Agent passing it the concatenated output of the List of Queues.</p>

      a command line Class, TymeacClient_7.&nbsp; The console output shows the result.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This Queue does not receive input directly from a Tymeac Client Request.&nbsp;
    Therefore, an Output Agent Queue cannot have prioritized Wait Lists.&nbsp; All requests go
    into Wait List 1.</p>
  </blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A Tymeac Function, <u>TyFuncMaint</u>, cannot specify an Output Agent Queue, (set here
    with Yes), as part of the List of Queues associated with the Function.&nbsp; A Tymeac
    Function may only specify an Output Agent Queue, (set here with Yes), as the Output Agent
    Queue for a Function.</p>

    <p>There is no restriction on the Processing Application Class for the Queue, above.
    &nbsp; The Class, Foo, may be the Processing Application Class for normal Queue
    &quot;Working 1&quot; as well as the Output Agent Queue &quot;Dynamic Session 201&quot;.
    &nbsp; Classes do their work irrelevant to the environment.&nbsp; They take an input

    enter a number here.</p>
    <p>This is a fixed number for all Wait Lists in this Queue. 
    This number is dynamically alterable in the Queue 
    Data GUI/non-GUI.</p>
    <p>As noted above, a large number of <u>physical</u> slots in Wait Lists 
    helps overcome FIFO errors but makes thresholds unusable.</p>
    <p><u>Logical</u> entries are the number of entries Tymeac considers for 
    threshold processing only. Think of <u>logical</u> as the normal top load on

    <p>The format is any number of digits as a percentage. Tymeac stores the number as a

    the number as 0.25F, for 5 percent, enter 05, Tymeac stores the number as 0.05F.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The basis of a <strong>Weighted Factor</strong> is that a priority 1 is more
  significant than a priority 2, etc.&nbsp; Tymeac multiplies the Weighted Factor by the
  reciprocal, (i.e., 1/x), of the Wait List number and rounds up the product.&nbsp; When
  there are three Wait Lists, with a Weighted Factor of five, then the Weighted Factor
  assigned to each list is: </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Wait List 1 reciprocal (1/1) is 1.000.&nbsp; 1.0*5=5.&nbsp; <br>
    Wait List 2 reciprocal (1/2) is 0.500.&nbsp; 0.5*5=3.&nbsp; <br>

    calculation exceeds the <strong>Weighted Average</strong>.</p>

  <p>Tymeac ignores zero value variables.&nbsp; Therefore, if you wish to bypass a
  threshold, enter 0.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Specifying 99 for <strong>Overall</strong>, <strong>Individual</strong>, and <strong>Weighted
  Average</strong> results in a new thread for 1 and 2 above, and only when all Wait Lists

    <p>If an overflow occurs, Tymeac activates a new Thread.&nbsp; However, when using <strong>Overall

  <blockquote>
    <p>E.G.&nbsp; For two Wait Lists, when only considering the first -- 50% is the first Wait
    List completely full, (that is, all entries in the first Wait List are in use and no entry
    in the second Wait List is in use). 25% is the first Wait List half full.&nbsp;For this
    example, when one desires a new Thread activated when the primary Wait List exceeds half
    full, then the following values accomplish this purpose:</p>

<p>Theory of the Weighted Average:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Priority Wait Lists requirements are not always obvious. Consider the requirement that
  the Queue requires Wait Lists for High, Medium and Low priorities. Using:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Wait List 1 for High,<br>
    Wait List 2 for Medium,<br>
    Wait List 3 for Low,<br>
    Wait List 4 for Just in case.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>seems like a workable solution.&nbsp;However, for this situation, the reality is that
  requests come into this Queue in bursts.&nbsp; Therefore, the structure is the following:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Wait List 1 for High, with 2 and 3 for overflow,<br>
    Wait List 4 for Medium, with 5 and 6 for overflow,<br>
    Wait List 7 for Low, with 8 and 9 for overflow,<br>
    Wait List 10 and 11 for Just in case.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The multiple overflow Wait Lists are for keeping detail account of the load on each
  group.&nbsp;Instead of having the High Wait List overflow into a Medium Wait List, or,
  having a single overflow Wait List for each group, multiple overflow Wait Lists, with a
  smaller number of Wait List entries in each, provide more detail on usage.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>With this structure <strong>Overall Percent</strong> considers all the Wait Lists and
  is not usable.&nbsp;<strong>Individual Percent</strong> has limited usability.&nbsp;With
  the smaller number of entries in each Wait List, an overflow activates a new thread.</p>
  <p>Therefore, <strong>Weighted Average</strong> considers only those Wait Lists that are
  currently in use, with a <strong>Weighted Factor</strong>, and, the number of threads
  currently working the Queue.&nbsp; </p>
