  <p><big><big>Elements:</big></big></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><a name="sys"></a><strong>Sys.exit():</strong>&nbsp; This Checkbox is<br>
    <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Not Checked</u></strong> for <strong>no</strong> shut down
    thread, <br>
    <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Is Checked</u></strong> for <strong>yes</strong>. Yes is the
    default</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The RMI server is keep alive by a thread that never ends.Tymeac Server also issues a
      never ending wait() so that the garbage collector does not eat necessary variables </p>
      <p>In order to end Tymeac Server after a normal shut down, Tymeac starts a thread at shut
      down.&nbsp;This thread calls System.exit(0) which ends the Java Virtual Machine. <strong>Not
      Checked</strong> for this option does not start this thread.&nbsp;The file line is either the String
      &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><a name="interval"></a><strong>Monitor Interval:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The interval, <u>in
    seconds</u>, that the Tymeac Monitor sleeps.&nbsp; Another way of saying this is the delay
    between running of the Monitor.&nbsp;When <strong>zero</strong>, Tymeac does not start the
    Monitor.&nbsp;Tymeac also uses this interval for timing
    of how long requests are in the system.&nbsp;When over this (interval (times a factor)) a
    request may be marked as possibly stalled. A good place to
    start is 60 seconds.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><a name="activate"></a><strong>Inactivation Minutes:</strong>&nbsp; This is the time, <u>in
    minutes</u>, to inactivate the Tymeac Server when no activity (see
    below) takes place for this interval.&nbsp;This is only valid for the Remote Object
    Activation System and when specifying a Monitor Interval, above.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>It is the Monitor that checks for time of activity.&nbsp;Therefore, there is a close
      correlation between the Monitor interval and the Inactivation Minutes. If one specifies an
      Inactivation time of one (1) minute and a Monitor interval of ten minutes (600 seconds),
      then the Inactivation time in effect becomes ten minutes.</p>

  <h3><strong>Buttons</strong></h3>
  <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Import:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>This button imports the current 
      settings in the server.</p>
      <p><strong>Alter:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>This button makes the changes you requested, 
      and re-imports the new values. Therefore, if you enter invalid data above, 
      then no changes are made. There is a println() in the console window of 
      the error.</p>

<h3><a name="activity"></a>Activity:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>An inactive Tymeac Server has no currently executing synchronous or asynchronous
  requests.<ul>
    <li>Requests in the Stall Array are active asynchronous requests.</li>
    <li>Timed-out synchronous requests are active until the Monitor frees the request.</li>
    <li>Recursive requests, whether synchronous or asynchronous, are active.</li>
    <li>Notification requests from the Monitor are active.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The inactivation time is irrelevant to the Server's Distributed Garbage Collector's
  Lease Value (java.rmi.dgc.leaseValue). Tymeac does not use the unreferenced notification
  of the java.rmi.server.Unreferenced&nbsp; interface.</p>
  <p>When there are no executing requests and there has been no request activity for this
  time interval, the Monitor executes the shut down user exits,
  if present, and calls: java.rmi.activation.Activatable.inactive().</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
